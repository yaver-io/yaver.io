# Yaver — Apple TV Remote Control + Audio/Metadata Streaming (Deep Analysis)

This is the implementing-agent's reference for adding remote control of an
Apple TV via a Raspberry Pi running the Yaver agent, with now-playing
metadata + artwork streamed to the mobile app and (optionally) a CarPlay
audio surface. It reconciles the build brief
(`Apple TV Remote Control & Streaming Feature Spec`) against the real
codebase, fixes four load-bearing wrong assumptions in the brief, and lays
out the concrete integration plan + milestones.

---

## 1. One-paragraph thesis

The control plane is cheap and the brief mostly gets it right: the agent
already reaches the Pi from anywhere over the relay/QUIC mesh, the mobile app
already has the exact device-control screen pattern we need (`arm.tsx`,
`remote-desktop.tsx`), and `linux/arm64` is already a shipped build target.
The *real* work and the *real* risk are: (a) standing up a **pyatv engine**
on the Pi — there is partial Python-sidecar prior art (the arm policy server)
but no socket-RPC supervisor yet; (b) deciding **ops-verb vs first-class MCP
tool** correctly (the brief says "first-class tool", but the mobile transport
the brief tells us to reuse is built around **ops verbs**, so the brief
contradicts itself); and (c) **not** building the two things the brief
correctly forbids — HDCP video capture and CarPlay video. Audio + metadata +
control is the whole product.

---

## 2. Brief-vs-code corrections (read before trusting the brief)

The brief's "Part 1 — Existing Architecture (ground truth, do not change)" is
**not** fully ground truth. Four claims are wrong or stale:

### 2.1 ❌ "Follow the existing Cobra command structure"
**Wrong.** There is no Cobra. `desktop/agent/main.go:336` is `func main()`
with a hand-rolled `switch cmd` at line 350 dispatching on `os.Args[1]`
(`case "vault":` line 434, `case "primary":` line 530). New command groups
add a `case "appletv": runAppleTV(os.Args[2:])` and a `runAppleTV(args)`
sub-dispatcher mirroring `runVault` in `vault_cmd.go:39-79`. Do **not** import
`spf13/cobra`.

### 2.2 ⚠️ "Sit alongside the Smart Home tools, follow their conventions"
**Half-true and a trap.** The Smart Home category (Sonos, Hue, Govee, Shelly,
HA, …) was gutted in the 2026-04-28 "lean-stack cut". The tool *schemas* are
still advertised in `mcp_tools.go` (e.g. `hue_lights` line 1533,
`govee_control` line 1549, `sonos_control` line 1561) **but their handlers are
dead stubs** — `mcpSonosControl`, `mcpHueLights`, `mcpGoveeControl`,
`mcpHAService` etc. all live in `mcp_dropped_stubs.go` and return
`{"error":"feature_removed"}`. So:
- The *registration pattern* (schema in `mcp_tools.go` → dispatch case in
  `httpserver.go` → handler fn) is still a valid template to copy.
- But there is **no live Smart Home category to belong to**. Apple TV would be
  *reviving* a tool family that was deliberately removed. That's a product
  decision, not a freebie. Flag it: do we want one live consumer-device tool
  in a tree that just cut all of them? (Recommendation: yes, but keep it
  self-contained in `appletv_*.go` so it isn't entangled with the dead stubs,
  and don't re-light the zombie schemas.)

### 2.3 ⚠️ "Preferred: a Python sidecar … (no prior art assumed)"
**Better than the brief thinks.** The brief proposes a supervised Python
sidecar as if it were novel. There *is* prior art: the arm subsystem ships
Python helpers the Go agent drives — `desktop/agent/arm/yaver_policy_server.py`
(a long-lived inference server), `arm/sim_harness.py` (embedded PyBullet),
`arm/yaver_lerobot_export.py`, and `scripts/parol6_bridge.py`. None is a
clean stdio-JSON-RPC supervisor, but the "Go agent owns a Python child that
speaks a local protocol" shape already exists and is the right model. See §5.

### 2.4 ✅ "Ensure GOARCH=arm64 is in the build matrix"
**Already done.** `.github/workflows/release-cli.yml:129-130` builds
`linux/arm64`; `cli/src/agent-runtime.js` (`resolveLocalAsset` ~line 482,
`fetchRemoteAsset` ~line 533) detects `linux-arm64`, downloads
`yaver-linux-arm64.tar.gz`, caches at
`~/.yaver/bin/<ver>/linux-arm64/yaver`. `npm install -g yaver-cli` on a Pi
already works. This acceptance criterion is pre-satisfied — just verify the
release after adding the feature.

---

## 3. Architecture decision: ops verbs **and** one first-class tool

The brief says "new MCP tools (register alongside Smart Home)" and lists
`appletv_remote_key`, `appletv_now_playing`, etc. as first-class tools. But
the brief *also* says the mobile app must "dispatch through the existing
P2P/relay client (same path as task creation)". Those two statements pull in
different directions, because:

- **First-class MCP tools** (`httpserver.go:handleMCPToolCallWithAddr` switch,
  ~line 5197) are **local-only**. No `machine` routing. Great for an MCP
  client (Claude Desktop) talking to the agent it's already attached to.
- **Ops verbs** (`ops.go`, `dispatchOps`, `registerOpsVerb`) carry a
  `{machine, verb, payload}` envelope with **full mesh routing + relay
  fallback + per-verb guest scopes + streaming streamIds**. The mobile app's
  device-control screens (`armClient.ts` → `quicClient.callOpsOnDevice`,
  `quic.ts:7718`) are built **entirely on ops verbs**. LAN-direct first, relay
  fallback, no call-site changes — exactly the brief's acceptance criterion
  "works on-LAN and remote without code changes at call sites."

**Decision — do both, each for its right consumer:**

| Surface | Mechanism | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile remote screen | **ops verbs** `appletv_*` | Reuses `callOpsOnDevice` mesh+relay routing; the Pi is remote, the phone roams. This is the *only* way the brief's "same transport, no call-site changes" criterion is actually met. |
| MCP clients (Claude Desktop etc.) | **thin first-class tools** that wrap the ops verbs | So the feature is usable from any MCP client per the brief. Mirror the **`robot_camera`** pattern (`httpserver.go:11850-11904`): a first-class tool that internally calls `dispatchOps(... Verb:"robot_snapshot")` and re-wraps the result. |
| `appletv_now_playing` artwork | **first-class image tool** | Must return an MCP `image` content block (base64 + mimeType), which the ops text envelope can't carry cleanly. Again: copy `robot_camera` verbatim — it already solves "ops verb returns a data: URL → first-class tool re-emits it as an image block." |

So the canonical implementation is: **ops verbs are the source of truth**;
first-class tools are thin `dispatchOps` wrappers. This is the established
`robot_camera` → `robot_snapshot` relationship, applied to Apple TV.

### Proposed ops verbs (in `ops_appletv.go`, `init()` → `registerOpsVerb`)
```
appletv_scan        {}                         -> list discovered ATVs
appletv_list        {}                         -> paired devices (from vault)
appletv_pair_begin  {id}                        -> start PIN pairing (streaming)
appletv_pair_finish {id, pin}                   -> store creds in vault
appletv_remote_key  {device?, key}              -> up/down/left/right/select/menu/home
appletv_launch_app  {device?, bundle_id}
appletv_power       {device?, state}            -> on|off
appletv_transport   {device?, action}           -> play|pause|stop|next|previous
appletv_seek        {device?, seconds}
appletv_now_playing {device?}                    -> metadata (+ artwork ref)
appletv_now_playing_stream {device?}             -> Streaming:true, streamId for deltas
```
`AllowGuest: false` on everything except possibly `appletv_now_playing`
(read-only) — pairing/control are owner-only by default, consistent with the
ops default.

### First-class tools (thin wrappers, register in `mcp_tools.go` + dispatch in `httpserver.go`)
```
appletv_remote_key, appletv_launch_app, appletv_power, appletv_transport,
appletv_seek         -> wrap dispatchOps, return mcpToolJSON(out.Initial)
appletv_now_playing  -> wrap dispatchOps, return MCP image block (robot_camera pattern)
```

---

## 4. CLI surface (`appletv_cmd.go`)

Mirror `vault_cmd.go:39-79`. Add `case "appletv": runAppleTV(os.Args[2:])` at
`main.go:~434`.

```
yaver appletv scan
yaver appletv pair <id>          # interactive PIN; writes creds to vault
yaver appletv list
yaver appletv key <name>         # up/down/left/right/select/menu/home/...
yaver appletv app <bundle-id>
yaver appletv now-playing        # JSON
yaver appletv power <on|off>
yaver appletv transport <play|pause|stop|next|previous>
yaver appletv seek <seconds>
```

Each subcommand should call the **same code path as the ops verb handler**
(not a parallel impl) — i.e. the verb handlers live in `appletv.go` /
`appletv_engine.go`, and both the ops registration and the CLI subcommands
call into them. One engine, three front doors (CLI, ops, first-class tool).

---

## 5. The pyatv engine on the Pi (the actual hard part)

Apple TV control is **IP-based** (MRP / Companion / AirPlay over the LAN) — no
HDMI, no IR. pyatv is the mature open-source engine. Decision: **supervised
Python sidecar over a local 127.0.0.1 socket**, not `atvremote` shell-outs.

### Why sidecar over CLI shell-out
- pyatv's push-updates (now-playing deltas) require a **persistent
  connection**; `atvremote` per-call re-pairs/re-connects each time (slow,
  ~1-2s, and loses the push subscription). The metadata-streaming milestone
  (§7) needs a long-lived connection — a sidecar is the only clean fit.
- The sandbox (`access_policy.go` Policy Guard) blocks arbitrary shell; a
  single whitelisted long-lived `python3 -m yaver_atv_bridge` invocation is
  far easier to audit than N `atvremote` shell-outs per session.

### Supervision pattern (copy the proven shapes)
There is **no existing stdio-JSON-RPC supervisor**, but two patterns compose
into one:
- **Daemon-start + readiness-poll**, from `models.go:Serve()` (281-322):
  `exec.Command(...).Start()`, then poll a readiness endpoint with a deadline.
- **Long-lived Python inference server driven by the agent**, from
  `arm/yaver_policy_server.py` + the Go side that launches/queries it. Same
  shape: Go owns a Python child, talks to it over a local transport.

Concretely, `appletv_engine.go`:
1. `ensureBridge()` — if not running, `exec.Command("python3", bridgePath,
   "--sock", "/run/user/<uid>/yaver-atv.sock")`. Bind to a unix socket (or
   `127.0.0.1:<ephemeral>` if unix sockets are awkward on the target),
   **never** a LAN-reachable port.
2. Poll a `{"method":"ping"}` until ready (deadline ~10s, `models.go` cadence).
3. JSON-RPC framing: one JSON object per line over the socket
   (`{"id", "method", "params"}` → `{"id", "result"|"error"}`). Keep it
   line-delimited — matches the SSE/blackbox line-delimited-JSON idiom already
   in the tree.
4. Restart-on-crash with backoff; surface "bridge down" as a clear ops error
   `code:"appletv_bridge_unavailable"` so the app shows a setup prompt
   (acceptance criterion: degrade gracefully).

### Where the bridge script ships
Put `yaver_atv_bridge.py` under `desktop/agent/appletv/` alongside the Go
(mirrors `desktop/agent/arm/*.py`). pyatv itself is **not** vendored — it's a
pip dependency the user installs on the Pi (`pip3 install pyatv`).
`yaver doctor` must report its presence (§6).

### Credentials → vault, never plaintext
pyatv pairing yields per-protocol credential blobs (MRP/AirPlay/Companion
tokens). Persist them via the vault Go API, **not** a config file:
- Write: `vs.Set(VaultEntry{Project:"appletv", Name:"<deviceId>",
  Category:"custom", Value:<json-creds>})` (`vault.go:468`).
- Read: `vs.Get("appletv", "<deviceId>")` (`vault.go:448`).
- **Vault v2 nuance** (correcting CLAUDE.md's blanket "vault locks on token
  rotation"): v2 (`YV2\x00`, master key from `~/.yaver/master.key` via
  `vault_keychain.go:EnsureMasterKey`) is **decoupled** from the auth token —
  pairing creds survive token rotation. Only legacy v1 vaults lock. On a fresh
  Pi this will be v2, so pairing persists across restarts and re-auths. Good.

The bridge process receives creds **only** from the Go agent at launch/connect
time (passed over the local socket, or via an env var the agent sets on the
child) — the Python side never reads the vault directly.

---

## 6. `yaver doctor` capability check

Add an Apple TV section to `runDoctor()` (`main.go:~6118`) following the
`probeTool` shape in `doctor_build.go:275`:
- `python3` present?
- `pyatv` importable? (`python3 -c "import pyatv"` with a 2s timeout)
- bridge script present at expected path?
- vault unlocked + any `appletv/*` entries paired?

Report `✓/!/✗` like the rest of `runDoctor`. This satisfies the brief's
"`yaver doctor` reports pyatv/sidecar availability" criterion.

---

## 7. Streaming: every primitive already exists

The brief's M3/M4 streaming asks map cleanly onto existing transports — **no
new public ports, nothing through Convex** (privacy contract holds because all
of these ride the already-authed relay/mesh tunnel).

| Need | Reuse | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| Now-playing **metadata deltas** | SSE fan-out, history-replay, drop-slow-subscriber | `logstream.go:223-264`; mirror `/incidents/stream`, `/operations/stream`. New route `GET /appletv/nowplaying/stream`. |
| **Artwork** image | Snapshot-poll + optional MJPEG, content-addressed cache | `ghost_stream.go` + `/rd/frame.jpg` (`remotedesktop_http.go:197`). iOS = poll `/appletv/artwork/latest.jpg`; web can use MJPEG. Cache `Cache-Control: max-age, immutable` like `vibe_preview_sse.go`. |
| Artwork **blob transfer** (one-shot) | multipart media path | `feedback_http.go:73-128` upload + `serveFeedbackFile` 159-198 serve. |
| Large/high-res payloads w/o iOS stalls | binary chunked QUIC wire | `relay_stream_wire.go` (magic `0xFE`, 64KiB chunks) — the iOS NSURLError -999 fix. |
| **Audio companion** stream (M4) | bidirectional WS, PCM frames | `/voice/stream` (`voice_http.go`) already streams 16k PCM frames both ways; Opus encode would be net-new but the WS transport is done. |

**Mobile consumption** must follow the documented iOS rule (from
`remote-desktop.tsx` + memory): **MJPEG only on web; iOS snapshot-polls**.
For metadata, SSE works on both. The now-playing card polls
`appletv_now_playing` (or subscribes to the SSE) every ~900ms, the same cadence
`arm.tsx` polls status.

### Audio capture reality (don't oversell M4)
- pyatv can act as an **AirPlay receiver** in some configs, but routing the
  Apple TV's *audio* into the Pi reliably usually means a **physical path**
  (HDMI-audio-extractor → USB/optical into the Pi), then Opus-encode.
- Content protection *can* still apply to the audio path depending on source.
  **Default to metadata-only**; treat audio as best-effort and gate it behind
  M4. Document this honestly in user-facing copy (acceptance criterion).

---

## 8. Mobile app (`mobile/`) — pure pattern reuse

Net-new is one client facade + one screen; everything else is reuse.

- **Client facade** `mobile/src/lib/appletvClient.ts` — copy `armClient.ts`
  structure exactly: LAN-direct attempt loop → `quicClient.callOpsOnDevice`
  fallback (`quic.ts:7718`). Methods map 1:1 to the ops verbs in §3.
- **Screen** `mobile/app/appletv-remote.tsx` — copy `arm.tsx` /
  `remote-desktop.tsx`: `useDevice()` for device picker + `connectionStatus`,
  `AppScreenHeader`, a `run()`/`sendCommand()` busy-wrapper, ~900ms poll loop.
  Layout = D-pad (up/down/left/right/select) + menu/home + transport row +
  now-playing card (artwork via `/appletv/artwork/latest.jpg`, title/app,
  scrubber).
- **Navigation** — expo-router filesystem route; add an entry point from
  `(tabs)/more.tsx` (`router.push("/appletv-remote")`). No new nav infra.
- **Connection-state UI, token refresh, multi-device** — all inherited from
  `DeviceContext` + `quic.ts`. No new network client (brief criterion).

### CarPlay (M4, optional) — confirmed greenfield
There is **zero** CarPlay code today (`mobile/ios/Yaver/Info.plist` has no
CarPlay scene/entitlement; no CarPlay target in the pbxproj). M4 would add:
- A CarPlay **audio app** entitlement + `CPTemplateApplicationSceneDelegate`.
- `CPNowPlayingTemplate` + a `CPListTemplate` of controls.
- **No `CPMapTemplate`/video templates.** Audio + metadata only.
This is a real new iOS target with its own provisioning — non-trivial, rightly
gated to last.

---

## 9. Hard non-goals (enforce in code comments + UX)

Straight from the brief, reaffirmed because they're also Yaver's "do no harm /
respect third parties" line and a legal line:

1. **No HDMI capture of the Apple TV.** HDCP-protected; software capture is
   blocked and circumventing it violates streaming ToS. No capture path may be
   left half-built in the tree (acceptance criterion). If a task seems to
   require it, **stop and surface the constraint** — do not engineer around it.
2. **No CarPlay video.** Audio app category only.
3. The *legitimate* adjacent feature — streaming the user's **own
   non-protected** sources (home media, IP camera, entitled IPTV) Pi→phone/car
   via FFmpeg→HLS/WebRTC — is **a separate track**, build only on explicit
   request, kept modular so it never entangles the Apple TV control path.

These belong as a doc-comment header in `appletv.go` and `ops_appletv.go` so
the next maintainer can't accidentally grow a capture path.

---

## 10. Milestones (ship incrementally)

| M | Scope | New files | Reuses |
|---|---|---|---|
| **M1** Control plane | pyatv bridge + supervisor; ops verbs; CLI `appletv`; vault pairing; doctor check | `appletv/yaver_atv_bridge.py`, `appletv_engine.go`, `ops_appletv.go`, `appletv_cmd.go`, doctor section | `models.go` supervise, `arm/*.py` shape, `vault.go`, `ops.go` |
| **M2** Mobile remote UI | client facade + screen + nav entry | `mobile/src/lib/appletvClient.ts`, `mobile/app/appletv-remote.tsx` | `armClient.ts`, `arm.tsx`, `remote-desktop.tsx`, `DeviceContext`, `quic.ts` |
| **M3** Now-playing streaming | metadata SSE + artwork snapshot/MJPEG + first-class `appletv_now_playing` image tool | `/appletv/nowplaying/stream`, `/appletv/artwork/*` routes | `logstream.go`, `ghost_stream.go`, `robot_camera` pattern |
| **M4** Audio + CarPlay audio app | optional; Opus encode + WS audio + iOS CarPlay target | CarPlay scene/templates, audio encoder | `/voice/stream` WS transport |
| **(sep.)** Own-source video | only on explicit ask | FFmpeg→HLS/WebRTC module | — |

**M1 is headless and terminal-testable** (brief's intent). Gate any
real-Apple-TV integration test behind an env flag in `.env.test`, mirroring
how remote-server tests are gated.

---

## 11. Open questions for the user

1. **Revive a consumer-device tool family right after the lean-stack cut?**
   The Smart Home category was deliberately gutted (§2.2). Apple TV is the
   first live consumer-device control to re-enter. Confirm that's intended
   (recommendation: yes, but self-contained, don't re-light the dead Sonos/Hue
   schemas).
2. **Audio scope.** Is M4 audio actually wanted, given it likely needs a
   physical HDMI-audio-extractor on the Pi and may hit content protection? Or
   is control + metadata the real product and audio a "later, maybe"?
3. **pyatv install UX.** Auto-`pip install pyatv` on first `yaver appletv` use
   (with consent), or doctor-only "please install"? (Recommendation:
   doctor-only + a one-line `yaver appletv setup` that pip-installs into a
   venv, never touching system Python.)

# PART B — Multi-surface "Yaver Anywhere": Pi capture-card source → car / glasses / phone

> Added 2026-06-16 after the user reshaped scope: *"open Yaver in apple car
> android car etc … from home streaming with my raspi config with capture card
> etc, also control … same for yaver glass case."*
>
> This is no longer "an Apple TV remote." It's a **home A/V source + control

## B.1 Posture: agnostic, like OBS (capture card + HDCP)

> **Supersedes the original brief's "HDCP non-goal" framing.** Owner decision
> (2026-06-17). The canonical statement is the **Streaming policy in CLAUDE.md**
> — this section just applies it.

Yaver is a **neutral streaming tool, like OBS**. A capture card appears as a
V4L2 device (`/dev/videoN`); `ffmpeg` reads it; Yaver streams those bytes to the
**owner's account or an explicitly-invited guest** (the `stream` scope) — never
public, never inspected or policed. It streams **whatever is provided, including
black** — an HDCP source blanks itself upstream, the card gets black, Yaver
streams black (with a terse `blackHint`, no nagging). What you capture/stream
and the right to it is **the user's responsibility**. The only line in our own
code: **no DRM/HDCP circumvention** (no stripper) — pass through what the
hardware gives. Source-agnostic by construction: satellite (`uydu yayını`),
set-top box, console, camera, PC, the Apple TV's non-DRM screens — all the same
code path. The Apple TV **control plane** (Part A) is the separate way to *drive*
the TV.

## B.2 Architecture: source vs. surface (build the source once)

```

**Key insight that keeps this tractable:** the *source plane* and the
*streaming/control contract* are **one body of work** (Part A verbs +
capture verbs + MJPEG/SSE routes). Every surface is a thin client of that
contract. We build the source + the phone client end-to-end; the other
surfaces are native shells that call the *same* endpoints.

## B.3 Per-surface reality (what each one can actually do)

| Surface | Runtime | Video? | Control? | Native work needed | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Phone (RN)** | existing app | ✅ (poll/MJPEG) | ✅ | none — reuse `quic.ts`/`DeviceContext` | **buildable now (M2/M3)** |
| **Android head unit** (aftermarket, full Android in dash) | **same RN APK** | ✅ non-protected (park/passenger) | ✅ | none — it's the same Android build; just install the APK | **free** (verify on device) |
| **Apple CarPlay** | iOS, projected | ❌ Apple forbids arbitrary video while driving | ✅ audio + now-playing + lists | new CarPlay **audio-app** scene + entitlement + `CPNowPlayingTemplate`/`CPListTemplate` | **scaffold; needs provisioning** |
| **Android Auto** | Android, projected | ❌ same restriction (media template only) | ✅ media controls + now-playing | new **MediaBrowserService** + `media-automotive` declaration | **scaffold; needs provisioning** |
| **Yaver Glass** (smart glasses) | platform-specific | ⚠️ tiny HUD video possible IF the glasses run Android/WebView | ✅ voice + now-playing HUD | depends entirely on the glasses platform (see B.5) | **design only; hardware-gated** |

The two **projected car** modes (CarPlay/Android Auto) are deliberately
**audio + control**, never video — that is Apple's and Google's rule for
safety, not ours to override. **Video in the car is only the parked
full-Android head-unit case**, and only for non-protected sources.

## B.4 The streaming/control contract (one set of endpoints, all surfaces)

All over the existing authed mesh (§7 primitives). New on the agent:

**Capture (video, the capture card):** mirror `remotedesktop_http.go`/`ghost_stream.go`.
```

ops capture_start {device,fps,width,height}  -> Streaming: capture frame loop

GET /capture/frame.jpg       -> latest JPEG (iOS/glasses snapshot-poll)
GET /capture/stream          -> multipart/x-mixed-replace MJPEG (web/head-unit)
                              -> reports HDCP-black as a clear 409, not a black stream
```
**Control + metadata (Apple TV, Part A):** the `appletv_*` ops verbs +
`GET /appletv/nowplaying/stream` SSE + `appletv_now_playing` first-class image
tool. Surfaces that can't show video (CarPlay/Android Auto) consume **only**
the now-playing SSE + control verbs — they never touch `/capture/*`.

**Why this shape:** a CarPlay audio template and an Android head-unit video
view are wildly different native code, but they call the *identical* agent
endpoints. Build the endpoints once; each surface picks the subset it's
allowed to render.

## B.5 Yaver Glass — honest take

"Yaver Glass" is not one thing; what's possible is entirely
platform-determined:
- **Android-based glasses (e.g. INMO, TCL RayNeo, Xreal w/ Android host)** —
  run the **same RN APK** or a slim WebView pointed at `/capture/stream` +
  the now-playing SSE. Tiny HUD video of a non-protected source + voice
  control is feasible. Closest to "free" (like the head unit).
- **Tethered display glasses (Xreal/Rokid as a USB-C monitor)** — they're just
  an external display for the phone; the phone app already drives them. No new
  code.
- **Closed platforms (Apple Vision-class, Meta)** — need a first-party app on
  their SDK; out of scope until there's a target device. Design the client
  around the same endpoints so porting is a UI layer only.

**Decision:** there is no generic "glasses" target. We make the **phone RN
client renderable on a small HUD layout** (a `?surface=glass` compact mode)
so Android glasses / WebView get it for free, and we document the rest as
hardware-gated. We do **not** scaffold a fake glasses SDK target.

## B.6 Revised milestones (supersedes §10 for the multi-surface scope)

| M | Scope | Buildable here? |
|---|---|---|
| **M1** Apple TV control plane (pyatv bridge, ops verbs, CLI, vault, doctor) + first-class tools | ✅ fully (headless) |
| **M1b** Capture-card engine (v4l2/ffmpeg → MJPEG buffer) + `/capture/*` routes + verbs, HDCP-black detection | ✅ fully (degrades w/o device/ffmpeg) |
| **M2** Phone RN surface: device picker, D-pad/transport, now-playing card, **capture video view**, compact `glass` layout | ✅ code; device-verify later |
| **M3** Now-playing SSE streaming + artwork | ✅ fully |
| **M4** CarPlay audio app (iOS scene/entitlement) | ⚠️ scaffold; needs Apple provisioning + device |
| **M5** Android Auto media service | ⚠️ scaffold; needs Play automotive review |
| **M6** Android head unit | ✅ same APK — verify on a real unit |
| **M7** Yaver Glass HUD | ⚠️ compact RN layout free; native glasses hardware-gated |

This session implements **M1, M1b, M3 (agent side) + M2 (phone)** in full,
and lays honest scaffolds/docs for **M4–M7**.

# PART C — Yaver everywhere: TV apps, peer streaming to own/guest accounts, an "OBS-wrap"

> Added 2026-06-16 after the user reshaped scope again: *"distribute yaver in
> android tv and apple tv … streaming so user can make mobile app camera stream
> to guest accounts or his account, likewise his pc or his tv stream … we may
> have obs wrap or similar features, simpler usage, full mobile app based."*
>
> This generalizes Parts A/B from "Apple TV + capture card" into **"every Yaver
> device is a streaming SOURCE and/or SINK, shareable to your own or a guest's
> account, with a simple mobile-directed compositor."** The capture/now-playing
> plane built in M1b/M3 is the foundation; this part is the generalization and
> the honest build sequencing.

## C.1 One model: sources, sinks, shares

```
  SOURCES (produce frames/metadata)        SINKS (render)
  • phone camera (expo-camera)             • phone app
  • PC screen (screenlog / ghost) ────►    • Android TV / Apple TV app
  • capture card (capture.go) ──── mesh ─► • car head unit / CarPlay-audio
  • Apple TV now-playing ─────────────►    • glass HUD
  • robot/host camera (robot_snapshot)     • web dashboard
                  │                                  ▲
                  └──── SHARE ──────────────────────┘
        own account: any device you own, instantly
        guest account: a "stream"-scoped guest token (read-only view, NOTHING else)
```

Everything rides the existing authed mesh; **nothing through Convex** (privacy
contract). This is already true for the verbs shipped this session.

## C.2 What shipped this session for C (the shared primitive)

`ops_stream.go` + a new **`stream` capability scope** (`ops.go`
`capabilityScopeVerbPrefix["stream"]="stream_"`):
- `stream_list` — enumerate shareable sources on a box (capture card, Apple TV
  now-playing, camera), read-only, **guest-viewable**.
- `stream_snapshot {source, device?}` — pull one frame as a base64 data URL
  (`capture` / `appletv` artwork / `camera` via `robot_snapshot`).

A guest token scoped `stream` is **isolated to `stream_*` only** — it can view a
shared source and reach nothing else on the machine (no control, no exec, no
vault), exactly like the `circuit` capability scope isolates Talos/OCPP to the
simulator. **This is the "stream to a guest account" core**, testable now.

The remaining streaming work is layered on this:

## C.3 Peer streaming — sources (the real native work)

| Source | Mechanism | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Capture card** | ffmpeg→MJPEG (`capture.go`) | ✅ shipped (M1b) |
| **Apple TV now-playing** | pyatv (`appletv.go`) | ✅ shipped (M1/M3) |
| **PC screen** | already exists — `screenlog`/`ghost_stream` (`/ghost/stream` MJPEG) | ✅ reuse; just expose via `stream_*` + guest auth |
| **Phone camera** | `expo-camera` frames → encode → push | ⚠️ NET-NEW native: a frame producer that POSTs JPEG frames to a box's capture-style buffer (low-fps, reuses the feedback multipart media path) OR WebRTC for real-time. Mobile-side capture + uplink is the bulk of the effort. |
| **TV screen** | tvOS ReplayKit broadcast / Android TV MediaProjection | ⚠️ NET-NEW native, per-platform; TVs can only broadcast their OWN app's content, not other apps (OS sandbox) |

**Phone-camera-to-account** is the headline new ask. Tractable path: the phone
runs a producer that grabs `expo-camera` frames at a few fps, JPEG-encodes, and
pushes them to a chosen box's frame buffer (a `POST /capture/push` mirroring the
existing feedback upload + the robot "external camera push" buffer the agent
already supports for `robot_camera`). Viewers (own or guest) then consume via
`stream_snapshot` / MJPEG. Real-time (sub-second, audio) needs **WebRTC**, which
is a larger lift — recommend low-fps JPEG push first (reuses everything), WebRTC
as a later milestone.

## C.4 Guest sharing — reuse the guest system, add a share object

Yaver already has guest infrastructure (`backend/convex/guests.ts`,
`desktop/agent/guest_*.go`; scopes `full`/`feedback-only`/`deploy`). A **stream
share** = mint a guest token with the new `stream` capability scope, bound to a
source + a source-device. The guest's app calls `stream_list`/`stream_snapshot`
(or, later, a guest-authed MJPEG endpoint) and sees ONLY that view. No new trust
model — it's the capability-scope pattern that already isolates the circuit
simulator, applied to live views. **Net-new:** a small share-create UI + binding
a share to a specific `{source, device}` (so a `stream` token can't enumerate
other boxes).

## C.5 Yaver as an Android TV / Apple TV app (distribution)

The TV is both a **sink** (big now-playing, a viewer for shared streams, a
remote target) and — limited by the OS — a **source** (its own broadcast only).

| Target | Reality | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Android TV** | The existing RN **Android APK** runs on Android TV. Needs: a `LEANBACK_LAUNCHER` intent + `android.software.leanback` feature (non-touch), D-pad **focus management** on the screens, and a TV-grid home layout. Buildable with the current Gradle/Expo setup. | ⚠️ config + focus work; no new toolchain |
| **Apple TV (tvOS)** | Expo/React Native does **not** target tvOS without the **`react-native-tvos`** fork + a tvOS Xcode target. This is a **separate build target** (own entitlements, focus engine, App Store tvOS submission). Significant. | ⚠️ large native effort; needs the RN-tvOS fork decision |
| **`?surface=glass` / `?surface=tv` layouts** | The RN screens already branch on a compact layout (shipped for glass). A `tv` layout = larger type + focusable rows; reuses the same components. | ✅ pattern in place; add `tv` skin |

**Decision:** Android TV is the cheap win (same APK + leanback + focus). tvOS is
a real project gated on adopting `react-native-tvos` — call it out as an ADR, do
not silently fork the mobile build. Both are SINKS first; TV-as-source (ReplayKit
/ MediaProjection broadcast) is a later, separate milestone.

## C.6 The "OBS-wrap" — simpler, mobile-directed, box-encoded

OBS = scene composition + mixing + encode + broadcast. A faithful on-phone clone
is heavy (GPU compositing + encode drains battery, fights the OS). The Yaver-
shaped, **simpler** version:

- **Phone is the director, a box is the mixer.** The mobile app picks sources
  (camera + a PC screen + an overlay) and a layout; a box (Pi/PC) runs the heavy
  `ffmpeg -filter_complex` compose+encode (it already has ffmpeg for capture).
  This matches Yaver's whole thesis — heavy work on the box, phone drives.
- **Scenes as data.** A scene = `{sources:[{stream, rect}], overlays:[{text|image, rect}], output:{fps, size}}`. Store in the vault; the box renders it with one ffmpeg graph. New verbs `scene_set` / `scene_start` / `scene_stop`, output to the same MJPEG/`stream_*` plane, shareable to own/guest exactly like any source.
- **Simple usage first.** v1 = one source + a now-playing/text overlay + push to
  viewers. Full multi-source mixing + transitions is a later milestone. Don't
  build an on-phone GPU compositor.
- **Broadcast out (RTMP to Twitch/YouTube)** is a trivial ffmpeg output target
  once compose-on-box exists — but it's third-party egress: identify honestly,
  user-initiated only, never a hidden loop (CLAUDE.md "do no harm").

## C.7 Milestones for Part C

| M | Scope | Buildable here? |
|---|---|---|
| **M8** `stream` guest scope + `stream_list`/`stream_snapshot` viewer verbs | ✅ **shipped** |
| **M9** view-only watch link (W3): `stream_share` token + `/watch` page | ✅ **shipped** (snapshot-poll; guest-authed MJPEG still optional) |
| **M10** Phone-camera source: `expo-camera` → `/stream/push` → box buffer → stream plane | ✅ **shipped** (agent `stream_push.go` + mobile `stream-camera.tsx`); device-verify pending |
| **M11** PC-screen source via `stream_*` + `screen_watch` (wraps `ghost`) | ✅ **shipped** |
| **M12** Android TV app (leanback + focus + `tv` layout) | ✅ **config plugin built** (`plugins/withAndroidTV.js`, unregistered per convention — needs a TV banner asset + native rebuild to activate; see the plugin header) |
| **M13** Apple TV (tvOS) app via `react-native-tvos` | ⚠️ **ADR'd + staged** (Part F) — dependency swap is owner-run (full native rebuild, version-locked); not executed here |
| **M14** Box-side "OBS-wrap" compositor (`scene_*` verbs) | ✅ **shipped** — in-process compositor (grid/row/pip) → publishes the `scene` source through the stream plane |
| **M15** RTMP broadcast-out | ✅ **shipped** — `stream_broadcast` pipes any source → ffmpeg x264 → FLV/RTMP (Twitch/YouTube/own) |
| **M15** WebRTC real-time | ✅ **shipped** — self-contained `/stream/webrtc/offer` reuses the pion `videoTrackPump` via a `stream-<source>` H264 target (ffmpeg JPEG→H264); web viewer in `AppleTVCellView`. Same-network now; remote needs TURN wiring (`turn_credentials.go` exists). Device-verify pending. |
| **W4** now-playing SSE live card (web) | ✅ **shipped** — EventSource via `nowPlayingStreamUrl()`, poll fallback |
| (fix) browser-session whitelist for `/capture/ /appletv/ /rd/ /ghost/` | ✅ — these media views couldn't mint their `<img>`/EventSource token before |

**Recommended next step:** M9 + M11 (make the streams I built guest-shareable
and add the PC-screen source — both are mostly wiring over shipped code), then
M12 (Android TV, cheap), then decide the tvOS ADR (M13) and the compositor (M14).

# PART D — Distribution playbook + TV sign-in + watch-a-remote-box

> Added 2026-06-17. Answers "how do I distribute in Apple car / Google car /
> Apple TV / Google TV", the TV QR sign-in ask, and "stream from magara (open
> YouTube/Netflix/Gain/Exxen via chat) to my phone."

## D.1 How each surface is actually distributed

The headline: **CarPlay and Android Auto are NOT separate apps** — they're
capabilities of the *existing* iOS/Android app. **Apple TV and Google TV** are
separate *form factors* of the same app record. You never ship a 5th store
listing.

| Target | How you distribute it | What it takes | Video? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Apple CarPlay** | The **same iOS app** on the App Store, with the **CarPlay entitlement**. | Request the CarPlay entitlement from Apple (developer.apple.com → an **audio** app category fits Yaver). Add `com.apple.developer.carplay-audio` to the entitlements, a `CPTemplateApplicationSceneDelegate`, and `CPNowPlayingTemplate` + `CPListTemplate`. Ship in the normal iOS binary. Apple must approve the entitlement. | ❌ audio + now-playing + lists only |
| **Android Auto** | The **same Android app** on Play, declaring an Auto capability. | Add a `MediaBrowserService` (media category) — or the Jetpack **Car App Library** for the IoT/POI categories — plus `automotive_app_desc.xml` + the `com.google.android.gms.car.application` meta-data. Passes an **Android Auto quality review** at Play submission (no separate approval for media apps). | ❌ media template only |
| **Apple TV (tvOS)** | A **separate tvOS binary**, same App Store Connect **app record**, new platform. | RN doesn't target tvOS in stock Expo — adopt the **`react-native-tvos`** fork + a tvOS Xcode target (own entitlements, focus engine). TestFlight supports tvOS. Submit as the tvOS platform of your app. **This is the one real new build target** (ADR-worthy). | ✅ full app incl. non-protected video |
| **Google TV / Android TV** | The **same Play app / AAB**, made TV-eligible. | Add `<uses-feature android:name="android.software.leanback" android:required="false">`, a `LEANBACK_LAUNCHER` `<intent-filter>` on a TV activity, a 320×180 TV **banner**, and D-pad **focus** handling. Passes the **Android TV quality** checklist. Google TV surfaces the same APK — no new toolchain. | ✅ full app incl. non-protected video |

**Sequencing:** Google TV/Android TV (cheapest — same APK + leanback + focus) →
CarPlay-audio + Android-Auto-media (entitlement/service on the existing apps) →
tvOS (the only one needing the `react-native-tvos` fork). Yaver's deploy scripts
(`deploy-testflight.sh`, `deploy-playstore.sh`) already cover the iOS/Android
binaries; tvOS would add a tvOS archive step, Android TV is the same AAB with the
manifest additions.

## D.2 TV sign-in — shipped (QR / device-code)

Typing credentials on a TV remote is miserable, so the TV uses the **device-code
flow** (RFC 8628) — the *same* one `yaver auth` uses headless, which Yaver
already has end-to-end (`backend/convex/deviceCode.ts`, phone approver
`app/approve-device.tsx` with a QR scanner).

Shipped this round:
- `mobile/src/lib/tvSignIn.ts` — `createTVDeviceCode()` → `POST /auth/device-code`,
  `pollTVDeviceCode()` → `GET /auth/device-code/poll`.
- `mobile/app/tv-signin.tsx` — shows a **QR** (`react-native-qrcode-svg`,
  already a dep) encoding `https://yaver.io/auth/device?code=…` + a big short
  code, polls every 5s, calls `login(token)` on approval, auto-refreshes on
  expiry.
- `mobile/app/index.tsx` — `Platform.isTV` routes unauthenticated TV users to
  `/tv-signin` instead of `/login`.

Flow: TV shows QR → user scans with the signed-in phone (already routes to
`approve-device.tsx`) or visits the URL → one-tap approve → TV signs itself in.
**No new backend** — reuses the existing device-code contract.

## D.3 Watch a remote box (magara) — open YouTube/video by chat

Shipped: the `screen_watch {url}` ops verb opens a URL in **that box's desktop
browser** (`openBrowser` → xdg-open/open/start) and returns the screen-stream
URL. So a chat command to the agent on magara — "open this video and stream it
to me" — opens it on magara and you watch via the existing **Remote Desktop**
(`/rd/stream`, `app/remote-desktop.tsx`) or `/ghost/stream`. `stream_list` now
includes a `screen` source; `stream_snapshot {source:"screen"}` returns a frame.

What composes here (mostly already-shipped):
- **Open / navigate by chat** → the agent's `open_url` + `browser_navigate` /
  `browser_click` tools, now plus `screen_watch`.
- **View the box's screen on the phone** → Remote Desktop (exists) / the screen
  source.
- **Share that view to a friend** → the `stream` guest scope (Part C).

### DRM (Netflix / Gain / Exxen / Disney+ …) — agnostic + warned
Premium services enforce **Widevine/FairPlay DRM + HDCP**; their video **blanks
under screen capture** because the browser/OS refuses to render protected frames
into a capture buffer. Per the §B.1 posture, Yaver is **agnostic**: it streams
whatever the box's screen shows **as-is** — if DRM content renders black, Yaver
streams black, with a `warning` that the content and the right to stream it are
the **user's responsibility**. Yaver adds **no** DRM/HDCP circumvention (that's
the one line in our code); it does not block or police otherwise.

`screen_watch` returns that warning. The natural pattern for premium services is
still to **control** them on the box (open/navigate/play-pause) and watch on a
licensed device — but Yaver doesn't enforce that; it just streams the pixels the
screen produces.

# PART E — Yaver Web UI deep analysis (dashboard surface for control + streaming)

> Added 2026-06-17 per "make deep analysis on yaver webui." Grounded in a
> read of `web/` (Next.js 15, Cloudflare Workers via @opennextjs/cloudflare).
> The web dashboard is the **fourth surface** (phone / car / glass / TV → web)
> and is the easiest to ship: it reuses one transport (`AgentClient` over relay)
> and the exact MJPEG pattern Remote Desktop already uses.

## E.1 How the web dashboard is built (ground truth)

- **Routing.** Each cell is a standalone route `web/app/dashboard/<x>/page.tsx`
  that pulls `token` (`useAuth`) + `devices` (`useDevices(token)`) and renders a
  `components/dashboard/<X>CellView.tsx`. Existing: `/dashboard/arm`, `/robot`,
  `/circuit`, `/printer`, `/screw-cell`, `/ci`, `/collection`, `/packages`.
  Adding a view = one `page.tsx` + one `CellView.tsx` + (optional) a nav tab in
  `app/dashboard/page.tsx`'s `tabs[]`.
- **Transport — relay-only.** Browsers can't reach the LAN (CORS), so the web
  always goes through the relay. `web/lib/agent-client.ts` `AgentClient`:
  `ensureClient(deviceId)` → `client.connect(host, port, token, id, {tunnelUrls})`
  with `setRelayServers(...)`; then `client.callOps(verb, payload)` POSTs to
  `${baseUrl}/ops` (baseUrl = `https://relay.../d/<deviceId>`). This is the web
  twin of mobile's `callOpsOnDevice` — **the `appletv_*` / `capture_*` /
  `stream_*` verbs I shipped are already callable from the web unchanged.**
- **Streaming in the browser.** `RemoteDesktopView.tsx` renders MJPEG with a
  plain `<img src={streamUrl}>`, where `agentClient.remoteDesktopStreamUrl()`
  builds `${baseUrl}/rd/stream?browser_session=<tok>&__rp=<relayPass>`. The
  **`browser_session`** token is key: an `<img>` can't send auth headers, so the
  agent issues a path-scoped session token (`POST /auth/browser-session`
  `{pathPrefix}`) that it promotes to a bearer, and the relay validates `__rp`.
- **Device state + auth.** `useDevices(token)` returns `Device[]` (with `online`,
  `needsAuth`, `tunnelUrl`, `publicEndpoints`); views show a picker and gate on
  `needsAuth`. `agentFetch(path)` is the JSON helper (used by `ScreenMonitorView`).
- **Build/deploy.** `scripts/deploy-web.sh` → `npm run deploy`
  (`@opennextjs/cloudflare build` + `wrangler deploy`), **15 MB size guard**,
  Cloudflare creds from `yaver vault env --project web`. Local dev: `npm run dev`.

## E.2 What an `AppleTVCellView` needs (mostly reuse)

| Need | Web mechanism | New? |
|---|---|---|
| Call control verbs (`appletv_remote_key`, `appletv_transport`, `appletv_power`, `appletv_launch_app`, `appletv_seek`, `appletv_scan/list`, `capture_*`, `stream_*`, `screen_watch`) | `client.callOps(verb, payload)` | ✅ reuse, verbs already shipped |
| Now-playing metadata + artwork | `callOps("appletv_now_playing")` → render `artwork_b64` as `<img src="data:…">` | ✅ reuse |
| Now-playing live SSE | `agentFetch("/appletv/nowplaying/stream")` (EventSource needs the browser-session token in the URL, same as MJPEG) | small |
| **Capture-card video** | a browser-session URL `${baseUrl}/capture/stream?browser_session=…&__rp=…` in `<img>` — **add `captureStreamUrl()` to `agent-client.ts` mirroring `remoteDesktopStreamUrl()`** | small NET-NEW |
| **Watch magara screen** | reuse the existing **RemoteDesktopView** (`/rd/stream`) + a `screen_watch` button (`callOps("screen_watch",{url})`) | ✅ reuse |
| Device picker / connection / auth | `useDevices` + `ensureClient` + `needsAuth` gate | ✅ reuse |

**Net-new for the web is small:** one `agent-client.ts` helper
(`captureStreamUrl()`/`captureFrameUrl()` — copy `remoteDesktopStreamUrl()`), one
`AppleTVCellView.tsx` (D-pad + transport + now-playing card + capture `<img>` +
a "watch a URL on the box" field), one route `app/dashboard/apple-tv/page.tsx`,
and a `tabs[]` entry (📺). No backend, no new transport.

## E.3 Guest stream-share on the web

The `stream` capability scope (Part C) is browser-friendly: a guest opens the
web dashboard with a stream-scoped token and an `AppleTVCellView` in **view-only
mode** — `stream_list` to enumerate, `stream_snapshot` for a frame, and (with a
browser-session) the `/capture/stream` `<img>`. The guest token reaches only
`stream_*` verbs, so a shared web link exposes the live view and nothing else.
This is the cleanest place to ship "send a friend a link to watch": web + a
stream-scoped guest token, no app install.

## E.4 Web rollout milestones

| M | Scope | Effort |
|---|---|---|
| **W1** `AppleTVCellView` + `/dashboard/apple-tv` route + nav tab; control + now-playing | small (reuse `ArmCellView` shape) |
| **W2** `captureStreamUrl()` helper + capture `<img>` + `screen_watch` field | small (reuse `remoteDesktopStreamUrl`) |
| **W3** Guest view-only mode (stream-scoped token) + a "share watch link" UX | medium (token mint + guest route) |
| **W4** Now-playing SSE live card (EventSource w/ browser-session) | small |

Deploy each via `scripts/deploy-web.sh` (local-first, 15 MB guard). The web
surface is the **lowest-effort, highest-reach** way to land the whole feature —
recommend W1+W2 right after the mobile/agent work is merged.

# PART F — ADR: Apple TV (tvOS) app (M13)

> **⚠️ SUPERSEDED for the chosen approach.** The canonical tvOS decision now
> lives in `docs/yaver-tvos-fork-adr.md`, which chose **Option B — a thin native
> SwiftUI tvOS app** (no `react-native-tvos` fork, avoiding the per-RN-bump fork
> tax). This Part F captured the *react-native-tvos* option below; keep it only
> as the rejected-alternative record. Use the SwiftUI ADR + `tvos/YaverTV/*` for
> implementation.

> 2026-06-17. **Decision: deferred-but-specified.** The tvOS app is a real,
> wanted target, but adopting it is the one step in this whole feature that
> can't be done safely without a full native build — so this ADR specifies the
> exact change and the gate, and the work is staged so the day-of swap is one
> command + a rebuild, not a research project.

## F.1 Why tvOS is different from every other surface here

Every other surface reused existing transport/UI. tvOS does not exist in stock
Expo/React Native: **the `react-native` package itself has no tvOS target.** The
only supported path is the community fork **`react-native-tvos`**, a drop-in
superset that adds tvOS while keeping iOS + Android. Adopting it means changing
the dependency for the WHOLE app:

```jsonc
// mobile/package.json — the swap (do NOT run blind)
"react-native": "npm:react-native-tvos@0.81.x"   // MUST match the current RN 0.81.5 minor
```

Risks that make this unverifiable-from-here:
- **Version lock-step.** `react-native-tvos` must match the exact RN minor
  (0.81.x) AND be compatible with **Expo SDK 54**. A wrong pin breaks
  `npm install` for iOS + Android too — i.e. it can take the shipping phone app
  down, not just "fail to add TV."
- **Native rebuild required.** `expo prebuild` + a tvOS Xcode target + `pod
  install` + a full archive — none of which runs in this environment. I can't
  confirm the phone builds still pass after the swap, and "ship a broken phone
  build to verify TV" is exactly backwards.
- **Expo 54 tvOS support is partial** — some config plugins / native modules in
  this app (mesh tunnel, GCDWebServer, rnwhisper) may need tvOS guards.

Per CLAUDE.md (local deploy first, don't destabilize shipping builds), executing
this swap autonomously is the wrong call. It's an owner-run, full-rebuild step.

## F.2 What's already staged so the swap is the ONLY remaining work

- **TV sign-in** (`tv-signin.tsx` + `Platform.isTV` routing) — already built;
  works the moment the app runs on tvOS.
- **Compact layouts** — the `?surface=glass` pattern is the basis for a `tv`
  skin; the Apple TV control screen already branches on surface.
- **The whole agent + transport** — unchanged; tvOS is just another client of
  the same relay/ops plane.

## F.3 The day-of runbook (owner, on the Mac)

```bash
cd mobile
# 1. pin the fork to the matching RN minor (verify the exact patch on npm first)
npm pkg set 'dependencies.react-native=npm:react-native-tvos@0.81.5'   # example pin
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
# 2. add the tvOS target
EXPO_TV=1 npx expo prebuild --platform ios --clean --no-install
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
# 3. build to a tvOS simulator/device, verify phone builds STILL pass
#    (run the existing iOS + Android builds before shipping anything)
# 4. add focus management (hasTVPreferredFocus / TVFocusGuideView) per screen
# 5. submit as the tvOS platform of the same App Store Connect app record
```

Decision recorded: **do not swap the dependency until the owner runs F.3 on a
machine that can complete a native iOS build and confirm it's still green.**
Android TV (M12) is the lower-risk TV win and is staged as a config plugin.

# PART H — The adaptive "watch layer": capability-aware, per-sink, lockable quality

> 2026-06-17, deep analysis. The user's insight: **the delivered quality should

## H.1 Why "stream the source as-is" is wrong for the watcher

Today every path encodes a fixed profile (`capture.go` 720p + `-q:v 7`;
`scene.go` defaults; `stream_webrtc.go` `fps=12` ultrafast; `broadcast.go`
fps=10). That's a one-size encode. The mismatches it creates:
- **Over-delivery to a small sink.** 1080p30 to a phone showing a 360-px card,
  or to glass with a 480-px HUD, wastes the box's CPU and the link's bandwidth
  and the phone's battery/decoder for pixels nobody sees.
- **Under-delivery / stall on a weak link.** The same fixed bitrate stalls on
  cellular or a far relay hop; the watcher wants *smooth 480p*, not *stuttering
  1080p*.
- **Latency cost.** Bigger frames = more encode + more bytes = more glass-to-
  glass delay. A live remote (Apple TV control loop, a projector) wants low
  latency over fidelity.

**Principle:** *deliver `min(source, weakest-link, final-sink-capability,
user-cap)`.* The "watch layer" computes that per watcher and re-encodes to it.

## H.2 The chain model (what to reason about)

```
 SOURCE            ENCODE            TRANSPORT             SINK(s)
 capture 1080i ─▶  ffmpeg  ─▶  LAN-direct | relay | TURN ─▶ phone ─▶? glass
 satellite/STB     (profile)      (RTT, loss, bw)           web      projector
 console/cam                                                tv-app   TV (cast)
```
Each watcher is an independent chain. Three caps stack:
1. **Source cap** — native res/fps of the capture (can't exceed it).
2. **Link cap** — measured: RTT, packet loss, throughput; or declared net type
   (wifi/ethernet/cellular). Sets a *safe bitrate*.
3. **Sink cap** — the final display: screen px, device class (phone/glass/tv/
   projector), decoder limits (some glass top out at 720p), battery.

The watch layer picks a `StreamProfile` = the floor of these (and the user lock).

## H.3 Adaptation levers, per path

| Path | Levers | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| **Snapshot / MJPEG** (`/capture/frame.jpg`, `stream_snapshot`) | JPEG quality, frame W×H, poll fps | phone thumbnails, glass HUD, low-power, iOS-safe |
| **WebRTC** (`/stream/webrtc/offer`) | encoder bitrate, scale (`-vf scale`), fps, GOP, profile/level | full-screen TV/projector, low-latency live |
| **RTMP** (`stream_broadcast`) | bitrate, scale, fps, keyint | public broadcast (fixed, platform-dictated) |

The **path itself is a lever**: a phone glancing at a card → cheap MJPEG poll; a
projector → WebRTC; a public stream → RTMP. Choosing the *path* by sink+latency
need is the first adaptation, before tuning the encode.

## H.4 Capability signals (how the box learns the cap)

- **Declared by the viewer** (cheap, immediate): render size in CSS+device px,
  `deviceClass` (phone/glass/tv/projector/web), `netType` (wifi/cellular/
  ethernet), battery saver. The web `RTCPeerConnection`/`<video>` knows its
  element size; RN knows screen + `NetInfo` + `Platform`.
- **Measured** (closes the loop): WebRTC `getStats()` (RTT, packet loss, NACK,
  `framesDropped`, available outgoing bitrate via REMB/GCC); for MJPEG, the
  client's achieved poll rate. The box steps the profile down on loss/dropped
  frames, up when headroom returns — with **hysteresis** (e.g. require N seconds
  stable before stepping up) to avoid flapping.
- **Final-sink discovery** (§H.7): when the phone re-projects, the *external*
  display's caps, not the phone's.

## H.5 Profiles + the user lock

Named tiers (a small set keeps fan-out cheap, §H.6):

| Profile | Scale | fps | ~bitrate | use |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `source` | native | native | source | LAN, max fidelity |
| `high` | ≤1080p | 30 | ~4 Mbps | TV/projector on good link |
| `balanced` | ≤720p | 25 | ~1.8 Mbps | default phone/web |
| `saver` | ≤480p | 15 | ~0.6 Mbps | cellular, glass HUD, battery |
| `auto` | computed | computed | computed | follow the caps + measured loop |

- **Auto** = the box computes the floor of caps and adapts live.
- **Lock** = the user pins a tier (per source or per their own view); auto is
  disabled for that watcher. "I'm on metered data — lock saver." "This is the
  projector — lock high."
- **Per-watcher**: the same source fans out to many watchers at *different*
  profiles — a phone on `saver` and a TV on `high` off one capture.

## H.6 Fan-out economics (the real cost decision)

Re-encoding per watcher is CPU-expensive on a Pi. Three strategies:
1. **Per-watcher ffmpeg** — simplest, N encodes for N watchers. Fine for 1–2
   watchers; doesn't scale on a Pi.
2. **Tiered / simulcast** — encode a fixed *small set* (e.g. saver+balanced+high)
   once each; assign each watcher the nearest tier. Bounded CPU regardless of
   watcher count; the WebRTC fan-out (Pion writes one track to many PCs) already
   does this for *one* tier — extend to 2–3 tiers. **Recommended.**
3. **Single + edge transcode** — encode once at source quality, transcode at a
   beefier node (a cloud relay) per watcher. Moves CPU off the Pi but needs a
   transcoding relay (future; ties into managed cloud).

Recommendation: **tiered (2–3 fixed ladders), Pion fan-out per tier**, watchers
snap to the nearest. Auto moves a watcher *between* tiers; it doesn't spawn a
bespoke encode.

## H.7 Multi-destination: phone → glass / projector / TV

The phone is often a *relay to a bigger sink*, and the sink's caps differ:
- **Phone → external display via cast** (Chromecast/AirPlay/Miracast): the phone
  hands the URL/stream to the TV; the *TV* decodes. Target the TV's caps (often
  it can do *more* than the phone — bump quality up). Yaver should detect a cast
  session and re-profile to the sink.
- **Phone → glasses** (USB-C DP / tethered): the glasses are a second display
  off the phone; their native panel res is the cap (often *lower* — a small HUD;
  re-profile down). Android/WebView glasses run the app directly → they're a
  first-class sink, not a phone relay.
- **Phone → projector** (HDMI/AirPlay): projector res (720p/1080p) is the cap;
  usually bump up + lower fps tolerance is fine (movies).

The watch layer models a `sinkChain`: the *terminal* sink's caps win. The phone
reports "I'm projecting to <class>" and the box re-profiles. Where the phone is a
dumb passthrough (cast), prefer handing the box's stream URL straight to the sink
(no phone transcode).

## H.8 Where it plugs into the shipped code

A single `StreamProfile` threaded through the existing encode points:
- `capture.go`: profile → `-video_size`, `-r`, `-q:v` (already takes w/h/fps).
- `scene.go`: profile → `cfg.Width/Height/FPS` (already params).
- `stream_webrtc.go` `SpawnCapture`: profile → `-vf scale`, `-r`, `-b:v/-maxrate`
  (today fixed `fps=12` ultrafast).
- `broadcast.go`: profile → scale/fps/bitrate (today fixed).
- Resolution: a per-source profile store + the viewer constraints on the
  `/stream/webrtc/offer` and `stream_snapshot` calls → resolve → encode.

## H.9 What shipped this session (foundation)

- **`stream_profile.go`**: the `StreamProfile` model + named tiers
  (`source/high/balanced/saver`) + `profileForConstraints(deviceClass, wPx, hPx,
  netType, locked)` (the floor-of-caps mapper) + a per-source profile/lock store
  (`stream_quality` / `stream_quality_get` verbs).
- **WebRTC honors it**: `/stream/webrtc/offer` now accepts
  `{deviceClass, w, h, net, profile}`; the encoder applies `scale`/`-r`/`-b:v`
  from the resolved profile (locked tier wins). The web viewer sends its
  `<video>` size + device class + a quality selector (Auto/High/Balanced/Saver).
- **Honest scope**: this is *declared-capability + lock* adaptation (the static
  half). The **measured live loop** (getStats → step tiers with hysteresis) and
  **tiered simulcast fan-out** and **cast-sink discovery** are designed here but
  not yet built — §H.10.

## H.10 Milestones

| M | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Q1** `StreamProfile` + tiers + lock + per-source store | ✅ shipped |
| **Q2** WebRTC/capture encode honor the profile + viewer constraints | ✅ WebRTC + capture (`capture_start {profile}` caps source res/fps/quality); scene/broadcast trivial follow-up |
| **Q3** Measured live adaptation (getStats loss → step tier) | ✅ web getStats loop: >5% loss×3 → step DOWN + re-negotiate; <1% loss×6 → step UP (anti-flap, slower). Live link health shown. Locked tiers untouched. |
| **Q4** Tiered simulcast fan-out (Pion per-tier) | ✅ `stream_webrtc_fanout.go`: one shared encode per (source, tier) — `getOrCreateEncode` + refcounted teardown; Pion fans the single H264 track to every viewer PC at that tier. At most one ffmpeg per tier per source regardless of viewer count. `stream_quality_get` shows live encodes. |
| **Q5** Cast/projector/glass sink discovery → re-profile to terminal sink | ⬜ designed (needs phone-side cast detection) |
| **Q6** Path auto-select (MJPEG vs WebRTC vs RTMP by sink + latency) | ✅ `stream_plan.go` verb `stream_plan {deviceClass,w,h,net,latency,public}` → recommends path+endpoint+profile (RTMP=public, WebRTC=low-latency/TV/projector, MJPEG=small/low-power); unit-tested. Plus capture+broadcast now honor a `profile` tier (Q2 complete across capture/webrtc/broadcast). |

## 11b. TURN enablement for remote WebRTC (no relay code change)

WebRTC media needs a relay candidate when both peers are behind NAT (the home
Pi + a remote viewer). **The relay software already ships a TURN/STUN server**
(`relay/turn.go`, wired in `relay/main.go` since v0.1.17) — it's **opt-in**, so
no code change is required, only deploy config:

```bash
# relay host (needs a WAN-reachable IP):
yaver relay serve --password <secret> \
  --turn-port 3478 --turn-public-ip <RELAY_WAN_IP>     # or env TURN_PORT / TURN_PUBLIC_IP

# the box running the stream agent:
export YAVER_TURN_URL="turn:<RELAY_WAN_IP>:3478"
# TURN auth shares the relay secret automatically (TURN_AUTH_SECRET → RELAY_PASSWORD)
```

Wired this session: the agent PC now uses `iceServersForPeer()` (STUN always +
relay TURN when `YAVER_TURN_URL` is set), and `GET /stream/webrtc/ice` serves the
same STUN+TURN list to the browser's `RTCPeerConnection`. With TURN off it's
STUN-only (same-network works); turn it on and remote CG-NAT viewing works. The
TURN password is a 60s long-term credential — the browser never sees the secret.
