# Yaver.io — Claude Code Project Guide

## Read This First
- Start with [`AI_ARCH.md`](AI_ARCH.md) before changing auth, bootstrap, relay, mobile discovery, or remote-recovery behavior. It documents the real runtime architecture and the current reboot/unauthenticated recovery path.

## Important Rules
- **Never push or commit without explicit user permission.**
- **Cloudflare deploy size guard**: `web/` must stay under 10 MB (currently ~2.5 MB). The deploy script enforces this. Do not add large assets to `web/`. The biggest file is `web/public/demo.mp4` (~1.2 MB, compressed from 8 MB original). If adding videos, compress aggressively first: `ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vcodec libx264 -crf 32 -preset veryslow -vf "scale=720:-2" -an output.mp4`. Prefer external hosting (YouTube embed, GitHub releases CDN) for anything over 1 MB.
- **NEVER use WebView to load third-party apps.** All app loading must be native (real UIView/android.view.View via ExpoReactNativeFactory with New Architecture). When "Open App" is tapped, use `/dev/build-native` to compile a Hermes bytecode bundle and load it into a native bridge with full TurboModule support — never a WebView. WebView is only acceptable for web content (landing pages, docs), never for React Native apps.
- **NEVER commit credentials, IPs, API keys, or secrets to the repo.** The repo is open-source on GitHub. All credentials must go in `.env.test` (gitignored), env vars, or GitHub Actions secrets. This includes Hetzner server IPs, Apple Developer keys, SSH key paths, relay passwords, Tailscale IPs, npm tokens, PyPI tokens, Google Play service account keys. If you see a hardcoded credential, replace it with an env var or placeholder immediately. **Also check git history** — if a credential was accidentally committed, it must be removed from history (via `git filter-branch` or BFG) before pushing to GitHub. Never write `.npmrc` files with tokens to tracked paths — use temp files and delete immediately after use. The npm publish tokens (`npm_...`), Play Store service account JSON, and App Store Connect API keys must never appear in any committed file.
- **Open-source safety — nothing sensitive may leak through any file that ends up in the repo.** Everything in `yaver.io/` is published publicly. Before saving a file, assume it will be read by strangers: no hardcoded credentials, no private infra IPs or hostnames, no internal-only URLs, no customer data, no personal identifiers, no file paths that embed usernames or secrets, no Slack/issue/PR links that could leak context, no raw logs from real users. Any "dev-only" shim, test fixture, or debug helper that touches real infra belongs outside the repo (e.g. `.env.test`, `../talos/`, or a gitignored scratch dir) — never inline it into a committed file because "it's just local." This applies to CLAUDE.md memory notes too.

### Secrets management
Every sensitive value lives in exactly one of three places — never in a tracked file or git history:

1. **GitHub Actions secrets** (for CI). Set with `gh secret set NAME`. The full list of secret names currently used by workflows: `ANDROID_KEYSTORE`, `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS`, `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD`, `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY`, `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_ID`, `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_ISSUER`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID`, `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY`, `CONVEX_SITE_URL`, `RELAY_HTTP_URL`, `RELAY_QUIC_ADDR`, `RELAY_PASSWORD`, `RELAY_SSH_HOST`, `YAVER_CI_SSH_HOST_PRIMARY`, `YAVER_CI_SSH_HOST_SECONDARY`, `YAVER_CI_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`, `YAVER_CI_SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS`, `NPM_TOKEN`, `PYPI_TOKEN`.
2. **Local gitignored files** (for dev machine): `.env.test`, `mobile/android/keystore.properties` (copy from `.example`), `keys/*`. These are in `.gitignore` and must never be force-added.
3. **Runtime env vars** (for ad-hoc scripts): e.g. `HOST=root@relay.example.com ./scripts/check-relay-watchdogs.sh`. Scripts exit 2 if required vars are missing — never fall back to a hardcoded default.

If you find yourself about to put a secret in a tracked file, stop: add the value as a GitHub secret + make the code read from env, then rotate the secret because it passed through your clipboard. If a secret was ever committed, rotate it AND purge from history with `git filter-repo --replace-text`.

## Repository & Deployment
- **Source of truth**: GitHub (`github.com/kivanccakmak/yaver.io`) — open-source, all development happens here. Push directly to `main` (or via PR). The local `origin` remote may still point at the legacy GitLab mirror — use the `github` remote (`git remote add github https://github.com/kivanccakmak/yaver.io.git`) or just `git push github main`.
- **Cloudflare Workers**: web deployed via `wrangler`. Manual deploy: `./scripts/deploy-web.sh` (builds with `@opennextjs/cloudflare`, pushes with `wrangler deploy`, size-guards `web/` at 10 MB).
- **Landing page links**: point to `https://github.com/kivanccakmak/yaver.io`

### Pushing to GitHub
```bash
# GitHub is the source of truth. The legacy GitLab mirror may still
# be wired as `origin`; add the github remote once and push directly:
git remote get-url github 2>/dev/null || git remote add github https://github.com/kivanccakmak/yaver.io.git
git push github main
```
Before pushing, scan for any credentials, IPs, or hostnames that
should not be in a public repo (the open-source safety rule).

## Dev Server Proxy (Hot Reload to Phone)
When a user asks to "run an app on my phone", "hot reload", "load the app", or "start the app":
1. **Do NOT tell the user to run commands manually.** The user only runs `yaver auth` and `yaver serve`. Everything else is automatic.
2. **Start the dev server using curl**:
```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:18080/dev/start \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(cat ~/.config/yaver/config.json 2>/dev/null | python3 -c 'import sys,json;print(json.load(sys.stdin).get(\"auth_token\",\"\"))' 2>/dev/null || cat ~/.yaver/config.json | python3 -c 'import sys,json;print(json.load(sys.stdin).get(\"auth_token\",\"\"))')" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"framework":"expo","workDir":"/absolute/path/to/app"}'
```
3. The Yaver mobile app **automatically detects** the dev server and shows a green "Open in Yaver" banner.
4. For Expo / React Native, the user taps the banner and Yaver loads the app through the native Hermes bundle path inside the Yaver app. WebView is only for web frameworks.
5. **After fixing code**, trigger hot reload:
```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:18080/dev/reload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```
6. Expo / React Native refresh through the native Hermes path; web frameworks refresh through the proxied WebView path.
7. **Never output raw `exp://` URLs, QR codes, or tell the user to run terminal commands.** Everything flows through the Yaver P2P channel automatically.
8. When done: `curl -s -X POST http://localhost:18080/dev/stop -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"`

### Dev Server — Supported Frameworks

| Framework | Detection | Dev Server Command | Hot Reload | Bundle URL |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|------------|------------|
| **Expo / React Native** | `expo` in package.json | `npx expo start --lan` or Metro via agent | Auto (Metro watches files) + `/dev/reload` | Hermes bundle / native load path |
| **Flutter** | `pubspec.yaml` | `flutter run -d web --web-port N` | `r` keystroke to stdin | `/dev/` |
| **Vite** | `vite.config.{ts,js}` | `npx vite --port N --host 0.0.0.0` | Auto (Vite HMR) | `/dev/` |
| **Next.js** | `next.config.{ts,js}` | `npx next dev --port N --hostname 0.0.0.0` | Auto (Fast Refresh) | `/dev/` |

### Dev Server — How It Works Through Relay

                                                          └──────────────┘
```

The agent's `/dev/*` endpoint reverse-proxies to the local dev server. The relay forwards HTTP requests transparently. React Native / Expo should load through the native Hermes path, while Vite / Next.js and other web stacks still use WebView.

### Dev Server — Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `desktop/agent/devserver.go` | DevServer interface, manager, 4 framework implementations |
| `desktop/agent/devserver_http.go` | HTTP handlers: /dev/start, /dev/stop, /dev/status, /dev/events (SSE), /dev/* proxy |
| `desktop/agent/dev_cmd.go` | CLI: `yaver dev start\|stop\|status\|reload` |
| `mobile/src/components/DevPreview.tsx` | Banner + native Hermes load path + web fallback |
| `mobile/src/lib/quic.ts` | `getDevServerStatus()`, `startDevServer()`, `reloadDevServer()` |
| `relay/tunnel.go` | SSE detection for /dev/events, 200MB body limit for /dev/ paths |

### Hot Reload for Native Apps (Swift, Kotlin)

Native apps compile to machine code — no runtime hot swap. For Swift/Kotlin, Yaver provides:
1. **Feedback capture**: SDK captures screenshots, crash logs, stack traces
2. **Build-deploy-restart**: Agent fixes code → rebuilds → pushes binary (ADB for Android, TestFlight for iOS)
3. **Iteration speed**: ~30-60s build-deploy vs instant JS hot reload, but fully automated

## Three-Part Architecture

Yaver has three distinct components for developers:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                        Yaver Platform                                    │
│                                                                          │
│  1. Mobile App (yaver.io)       ── App Store / Play Store               │
│     • Native container for testing third-party RN apps                   │
│     • AI agent control from phone (tasks, feedback, hot reload)          │
│     • HTTP server on port 8347 for receiving pushed bundles              │
│                                                                          │
│  2. Push-to-Device CLI (yaver-cli)  ── npm install -g yaver-cli         │
│     • For third-party developers to push THEIR existing RN projects      │
│     • Analyzes compatibility, bundles JS, compiles Hermes, pushes        │
│     • Talks directly to phone's HTTP server (no agent needed)            │
│                                                                          │
│  3. Desktop Agent (yaver)       ── brew install yaver                   │
│     • Go binary for AI agent connectivity (P2P, relay, MCP)             │
│     • Hot reload dev servers (Expo, Flutter, Vite, Next.js)             │
│     • Session transfer, tasks, builds, deploys                           │
│     • Not needed for push-to-device — that's CLI→phone direct           │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key distinction:** `yaver-cli` (npm) and `yaver` (Go binary) are completely separate tools for different use cases. `yaver-cli` is for third-party RN developers who want to test their apps on real devices. `yaver` is for running AI agents from your phone. A developer might use both.

## Push to Device (yaver-cli)

Yaver doubles as a native container app (like Expo Go) for existing React Native projects. Developers push their existing RN projects to the yaver.io phone app via `yaver-cli` for real-device testing.

### Architecture

└─────────────────────┘                     └─────────────────────┘
```

### Key Files
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `mobile/sdk-manifest.json` | Source of truth — RN version, Hermes BC, native modules |
| `mobile/ios/Yaver/YaverHTTPServer.swift` | iOS HTTP server (GCDWebServer on port 8347) |
| `mobile/ios/Yaver/YaverInfo.swift` + `.m` | YaverInfo native module (isYaver detection) |
| `mobile/android/.../YaverHTTPServer.kt` | Android HTTP server (NanoHTTPD on port 8347) |
| `mobile/android/.../YaverInfoModule.kt` | Android YaverInfo native module |
| `cli/` | `yaver-cli` npm package root |
| `cli/src/analyzer.js` | Project analysis — RN version, native module compatibility |
| `cli/src/bundler.js` | JS bundling + hermesc compilation |
| `cli/src/discovery.js` | Device discovery (UDP beacon, LAN scan, manual IP) |
| `cli/src/transport.js` | HTTP push to device |
| `cli/src/commands/` | init, push, doctor, devices, modules, reset, status |

### SDK Manifest Contract
The `sdk-manifest.json` must be kept in sync across:
1. `mobile/sdk-manifest.json` (source of truth)
2. `mobile/android/app/src/main/assets/sdk-manifest.json` (Android copy)
3. iOS bundle (Xcode → Copy Bundle Resources → sdk-manifest.json)
4. `cli/sdk-manifest.json` (CLI copy)

When updating native modules in `mobile/package.json`, update the manifest and copy to all locations.

### Hermes Bytecode Validation
Both CLI and device validate Hermes bytecode version matches. The CLI ships its own `hermesc` (from RN 0.81.5, located at `cli/hermesc/`) to guarantee BC version match. HBC header format: magic `0x1F1903C1` at offset 4, BC version at offset 8 (uint32 LE, currently 96). Validation is done by `ValidateHBC()` in `desktop/agent/bundlecheck.go` (Go side) and `YaverBundleValidator.swift` (iOS side).

### Safe Bridge Reload
When a bundle is pushed, `safeReloadBridge` invalidates the old bridge and polls for deallocation (weak-reference check, up to 3s timeout) before creating a new one. The wait lets Hermes HadesGC thread finish — without it, GC touches freed memory → SIGABRT on TestFlight. The new guest bridge is created via `ExpoReactNativeFactory` + `RCTAppDependencyProvider` (same pattern as the primary app), which provides full New Architecture support including TurboModules, Fabric, and JSI. This is required for RN 0.81+ apps that use `TurboModuleRegistry.getEnforcing()` for core modules like `PlatformConstants`.

### Platform Support for Push to Device

React Native / Expo is the **only** framework with full push-to-device container support. Other frameworks have hot reload (dev server proxy) or build-only support.

| Platform | Push to Device | Hot Reload | Build & Upload | Implementation |
|----------|:-:|:-:|:-:|-----|
| **React Native / Expo** | Yes | Yes | Yes | `cli/src/bundler.js` → hermesc → HTTP POST to phone. Guest bridge via `ExpoReactNativeFactory`. |
| **Flutter** | -- | Yes | Yes | `devserver.go` `FlutterDevServer`: `flutter run -d <device>`, hot reload via stdin `r`. |
| **Vite** | -- | Yes | -- | `devserver.go` `ViteDevServer`: dev server on port 5173, proxied via P2P. WebView on phone. |
| **Next.js** | -- | Yes | -- | `devserver.go` `NextDevServer`: dev server on port 3000, proxied via P2P. WebView on phone. |
| **Swift / Xcode** | -- | -- | Yes | `build_cmd.go`: `xcodebuild` → TestFlight via `testflight.go`. Full binary each time. |
| **Kotlin / Gradle** | -- | -- | Yes | `build_cmd.go`: Gradle APK/AAB → Play Store via `testflight.go`. Full binary each time. |

**Why only React Native?** RN apps are JavaScript — you can compile JS into Hermes bytecode and load it into a pre-built native container (like Expo Go). Flutter uses Dart VM, Swift/Kotlin compile to machine code. These can't be injected into a container app.

### Technical Glossary (React Native Internals)

Reference for understanding the push-to-device pipeline and bridge architecture.

- **Hermes** — Meta's JavaScript engine for React Native. Pre-compiles JS into bytecode for fast startup. Ships as part of the RN binary.
- **Hermes Bytecode (HBC)** — Compiled JS output. Header: magic `0x1F1903C1` at offset 4, BC version (e.g. 96) at offset 8. Both CLI and phone validate these match. Mismatch = crash (like running Java 21 bytecode on Java 8 JVM).
- **hermesc** — The Hermes compiler binary. Takes JS input, outputs `.jsbundle` HBC file. Yaver embeds its own hermesc (from RN 0.81.5) to guarantee BC version match. Located at `cli/hermesc/`.
- **Metro** — React Native's JavaScript bundler (like webpack). Combines all source files + node_modules into a single JS bundle. Yaver's CLI calls `npx react-native bundle` which uses Metro under the hood.
- **RCTBridge** — The old-architecture bridge between JS and native. Passes JSON messages asynchronously. **Do not use for guest apps** — lacks TurboModule support, crashes on RN 0.81+.
- **ExpoReactNativeFactory** — Expo's factory that creates a bridge with full New Architecture support. Used for both Yaver's own app and guest apps. Configured with `RCTAppDependencyProvider` which registers all TurboModules.
- **RCTAppDependencyProvider** — Registers TurboModules (PlatformConstants, DeviceInfo, etc.) into the bridge's JSI runtime. Without it, `TurboModuleRegistry.getEnforcing()` throws → crash.
- **TurboModules** — New Architecture native modules that use JSI for synchronous, direct JS↔native calls (vs old bridge's async JSON). RN 0.81+ uses TurboModules by default for all core modules.
- **Fabric** — New Architecture rendering system. Uses JSI for direct communication between JS and native UI. Replaces the old async "shadow thread" approach.
- **JSI (JavaScript Interface)** — C++ API that lets native code interact directly with the JS runtime. Foundation for TurboModules and Fabric. Much faster than the old JSON bridge.
- **New Architecture** — Umbrella term for TurboModules + Fabric + JSI. Enabled by default in RN 0.76+. Yaver's `sdk-manifest.json` has `newArch: true, fabric: true`.
- **Native Container** — Yaver's phone app with 40+ native modules pre-compiled in. Guest apps run inside it using the pre-installed modules. Same concept as Expo Go.
- **sdk-manifest.json** — Declares what's available in the container: RN version, Hermes BC version, architecture flags, and all pre-installed native modules with versions. Must match between CLI and phone.
- **Safe Bridge Reload** — The sequence: invalidate old bridge → poll for deallocation (Hermes GC cleanup) → create new bridge via factory. Skipping the wait → SIGABRT from GC touching freed memory.
- **HadesGC** — Hermes's concurrent garbage collector. Runs on a background thread. After bridge invalidation, the GC thread may still be running — must wait for it to finish before creating a new bridge.

## What is Yaver?
Yaver is an open-source P2P tool that lets developers use any AI coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, Aider, Ollama, etc.) from their mobile device or any terminal, connecting directly to their development machines. Task data flows peer-to-peer between your devices — servers only handle auth and peer discovery.

### Connection strategy (per surface)

Each client surface has a different connection strategy based on platform capabilities:

| Surface | Strategy | Direct LAN | Relay | Local IPC |
|---------|----------|:----------:|:-----:|:---------:|
| **Mobile app** | Direct-first, relay-fallback | Yes (UDP beacon + Convex IP) | Yes | N/A |
| **Desktop Electron** | Local-first, then direct, then relay | Yes | Yes | Yes (`localhost:18080`) |
| **Web dashboard** | Relay-only | No (browser CORS blocks localhost) | Yes | No |
| **Go CLI** | Direct (same machine) | N/A | N/A | Always local |

**Mobile app** (`mobile/src/lib/quic.ts`):
1. On WiFi: try LAN beacon IP (2s) → Convex-known IP (2s) → relay servers
2. On cellular: skip direct, go straight to relay
3. Reconnects automatically on network changes (WiFi ↔ cellular)

**Desktop Electron** (`desktop/app/src/main/main.js`):
1. Probe `localhost:18080` for local Go agent (IPC — same machine)
2. If local agent found + auth works → connect locally (no relay needed)
3. If local not found → try direct LAN → relay servers (same as mobile)
4. Stores its own token in `~/.yaver/desktop-settings.json` (never overwrites CLI's `config.json`)

**Web dashboard** (`web/lib/agent-client.ts`):
1. Always uses relay — browsers cannot access `localhost` on the user's machine
2. Fetches relay password from Convex user settings
3. All requests go through `https://relay.yaver.io/d/{deviceId}/...`
4. This is by design — the web dashboard is for remote access (e.g., normie guest connecting to a developer's machine)

**Go CLI** (`desktop/agent/`):
1. Always runs locally — serves on `0.0.0.0:18080`
2. Connects outbound to relay servers via QUIC tunnels
3. No relay needed for local access

### Token isolation (multi-surface auth)

Each surface stores its own session token independently. The same OAuth user can be signed into all surfaces simultaneously:

| Surface | Token storage | Scope |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| Go CLI | `~/.yaver/config.json` (`auth_token`) | Agent API access |
| Desktop Electron | `~/.yaver/desktop-settings.json` (`authToken`) | Convex + agent (via IPC or relay) |
| Mobile | iOS Keychain / Android SecureStore | Convex + agent (via direct/relay) |
| Web | `localStorage` (`yaver_auth_token`) | Convex + agent (via relay) |

Signing out on one surface does not affect others. The Desktop Electron app never writes to `config.json` to avoid corrupting the Go CLI's token.

## Directory Structure
- `desktop/` — Electron installer + desktop app + Go CLI agent
  - `desktop/installer/` — Electron app for installation GUI

## Privacy Contract — what lives in Convex vs. on your machine

Yaver's core promise: Convex is used **only** for identity, peer discovery, and session bookkeeping. Every piece of data that's sensitive, personal, or derived from the user's own work stays on the user's own devices and flows peer-to-peer.

### Allowed in Convex

| Table / data | Why it's there |
|---|---|
| `users` | OAuth identity (Apple / Google / Microsoft / email) — needed for sign-in |
| `sessions` | Long-lived bearer tokens, stored **as hashes** (`tokenHash`), never raw |
| `sdkTokens` | Labeled API keys — stored as `tokenHash` only; raw token is returned once on create and never re-surfaced |
| `devices` | Device registry: `deviceId`, `hostname`, `platform`, `lastHeartbeat`, quic host/port — needed for peer discovery |
| `relayServers` / `platformConfig` | Which relays are currently available and at what URL |
| `guestInvitations`, `guestAccess` | Email + 6-char invite code + grant status — needed so guests can accept from any OAuth provider |
| `teams`, `teamMembers` | Team membership for shared-machine mode |
| `userProjects` | Slug + deviceId + stack/backend/auth flags + gitBranch + lastCommit — **no absolute path** |
| Activity audit summaries | `action`, `target`, `outcome`, `timestamp` — no payloads |

### Forbidden in Convex (enforced)

| Data | Where it lives instead |
|---|---|
| Vault values (`VaultEntry.Value`) | `~/.yaver/vault.enc` on the host (AES-GCM + Argon2id) |
| Raw SDK tokens / API key plaintext | Held only in the agent process + returned once to the creator |
| Task input prompts + output (stdout/stderr) | Agent's `~/.yaver/tasks/` + streamed P2P to clients |
| File / blob / shared-storage contents | Never leave the agent's machine |
| Exec session output | Same — agent-only, streamed P2P |
| Absolute filesystem paths | Never sent — they contain the user's home-dir username. Clients fetch real paths P2P from the agent's `/projects` endpoint |
| Internal LAN IPs of customers' downstream infra | Agent metadata only holds the device's own LAN IP for beacon discovery |

### How the contract is enforced

- All Convex-bound calls on the agent go through `convexSyncer.callMutation` (`desktop/agent/convex_state_sync.go`). A test-only recorder hook (`convexMutationRecorder`) lets tests capture every payload.
- `desktop/agent/convex_privacy_test.go` exercises `syncProjects` / `syncServices` / `recordActivity` and asserts:
  - Payload maps contain none of the forbidden keys (`path`, `workDir`, `token`, `stdout`, `output`, `logs`, `secret`, `vaultValue`, `privateKey`, `fileContent`, …).
  - No string value contains `/Users/`, `/home/`, `/root/`, or `C:\Users\` — i.e. no absolute path leaks via a surprise field.
  - A marker in a test-fixture home directory never appears in any value — i.e. username leaks are impossible to miss.
- The Convex-side mutation (`backend/convex/agentSync.ts::upsertProject`) also strips `path` at the boundary so a legacy agent that still sends one gets silently redacted before insert.

If you need to add a new sync path, append the new forbidden keys to `fieldsWeForbidInAnyConvexPayload` in `convex_privacy_test.go` and add a test for your payload. Adding data through a new code path that bypasses `callMutation` is not allowed without an explicit privacy review.

## Tech Stack
- **Networking**: Application-layer QUIC relay (direct-first, relay-fallback). No TUN/TAP, no VPN rights — won't conflict with user's VPN.
- **Relay Server**: Go with `quic-go`, self-hostable via Docker. Password-protected. Agents connect outbound via QUIC tunnels; mobile makes short-lived HTTP requests.
- **Auth**: Convex + Google Sign-In + Apple Sign-In + Microsoft/Office 365
- **Desktop Agent**: Go with quic-go, runs any AI agent CLI in tmux
- **Desktop Installer**: Electron (electron-builder for DMG/EXE/DEB)
- **Mobile**: React Native (native builds via xcodebuild/Gradle)
- **Web**: Next.js, deployed on Vercel (yaver.io)
- **Backend**: Convex (auth tables + device registry + platform config for relay servers)

## Key Design Decisions
1. **P2P only** — Convex is ONLY for auth, peer discovery, and platform config. Task data, logs, and output flow directly between mobile and desktop agent (via relay if needed, but relay doesn't store anything).
2. **Desktop = installer + CLI** — The Electron app is only for installation. The actual agent is a Go CLI binary.
3. **Privacy-first** — No code, task data, or AI output ever touches our servers. The relay is a pass-through proxy.
4. **Self-hostable relay** — Users can deploy their own relay server with Docker + password auth, or use Tailscale instead.
5. **Multi-relay redundancy** — Multiple relay servers can be configured. If one goes down, traffic routes through others. Clients try all relays in priority order.
6. **Application-layer only** — No TUN/TAP, no VPN rights. Won't conflict with user's existing VPN.
7. **LLM-agnostic** — Works with any terminal AI agent: Claude Code, Codex, Aider, Ollama, Qwen, etc.
9. **Voice-first mobile** — Voice input is always available in the mobile app and Feedback SDK. Audio is recorded on-device and sent to the agent for transcription. S2S providers (PersonaPlex, OpenAI Realtime) are optional for real-time voice conversations.
10. **Provider-agnostic voice** — Like LLM-agnosticism for coding agents, voice is provider-agnostic: PersonaPlex (free, on-prem), OpenAI Realtime (paid, cloud), or any future provider via the VoiceProvider interface.
8. **Session Transfer** — Transfer AI agent sessions (Claude Code, Aider, Codex, Goose, Amp, OpenCode) between machines via `yaver session transfer`. Includes conversation history, agent-specific state files, and optional workspace (via git or tar). Also available as MCP tools for use directly from within AI agents.
11. **Guest Access** — Share your machine with anyone via `yaver guests invite <email>`. No team/subscription needed. Guests get scoped access (tasks, feedback, dev server) but can't access shell, vault, or sessions. Max 5 guests per host, invitations expire in 2 days. Works from CLI, mobile app, and MCP.

## Voice AI Architecture

Yaver supports provider-agnostic real-time voice AI. Voice input is always available (mobile/SDK can always record and send audio). Speech-to-speech providers are optional enhancements.

### Providers

| Provider | Type | Cost | GPU | Setup |
|----------|------|------|-----|-------|
| NVIDIA PersonaPlex 7B | On-prem S2S | Free | NVIDIA A100/H100 or Apple Silicon | `yaver voice setup --provider personaplex` |
| OpenAI Realtime API | Cloud S2S | Paid per token | None (cloud) | `yaver voice setup --provider openai --api-key <key>` |
| Whisper (local) | STT only | Free | Optional | `yaver config set speech.provider whisper` |
| OpenAI Whisper API | STT only | $0.003/min | None | `yaver config set speech.provider openai` |
| Deepgram Nova-2 | STT only | $0.004/min | None | `yaver config set speech.provider deepgram` |
| AssemblyAI | STT only | $0.002/min | None | `yaver config set speech.provider assemblyai` |

### How Voice Flows

```
Phone (mic) → Yaver mobile/SDK → agent HTTP /voice/transcribe → Provider (S2S or STT)
                                                                      ↓
Phone (text result) ← agent HTTP response ← transcribed text ←───────┘
```

- **Always-on voice input**: Mobile app and Feedback SDK always show a mic button. Audio is recorded on-device.
- **Auto-transcription**: If STT or S2S is configured on the agent, audio is transcribed automatically.
- **Fallback**: If no provider is configured, raw audio is saved and attached to the task/feedback for the AI agent.
- **Capability discovery**: Mobile checks `/voice/status` and `/info` (includes `voiceInputEnabled`, `voiceProvider`, `sttProvider`). Beacon includes `vc` flag.

### Cloud Dev Machine (GPU tier)

Two tiers (all dedicated, no sharing):
- **CPU Machine** ($49/mo) — 8 vCPU / 16 GB RAM / 160 GB NVMe (Hetzner CX42). Pre-installed: Node.js, Python, Go, Rust, Docker, Expo CLI, EAS CLI, Yaver server.
- **GPU Machine** ($449/mo) — Dedicated NVIDIA RTX 4000, 20 GB VRAM (Hetzner GEX44). Includes Ollama + Qwen 2.5 Coder 32B, PersonaPlex 7B (voice AI), Whisper (STT). Full local AI stack.
- **Managed Relay** ($10/mo) — shared relay infra, no dedicated server.

**Multi-user / Team mode**: CPU and GPU machines support `--multi-user` mode for team sharing. Each user gets isolated workspace, tasks, and sessions. GPU resources are shared across team members. See "Multi-User Mode" section below.

**Important**: Never mention Hetzner, server costs, or infrastructure provider in customer-facing content (landing page, CLI output, emails). Customers buy convenience and reliability, not a reseller relationship.

## Feedback SDK (Error Capture + Black Box Streaming)

The Feedback SDK captures visual bug reports from device testing and sends them to the AI agent. Available for React Native, Flutter, and Web.

### Error Capture (observe-only, no conflicts)
The SDK **never hijacks global error handlers** — no conflicts with Sentry, Crashlytics, Bugsnag, or any other tool. Two explicit patterns:
- `wrapErrorHandler(existing)` — pass-through wrapper for the error handler chain
- `attachError(err, metadata)` — manual capture in catch blocks
- `wrapConsole()` — opt-in console.log/warn/error interception (BlackBox only)

### Black Box Streaming (flight recorder)
Continuous streaming of all app events to the agent via `/blackbox/events`:
- Event types: `log`, `error`, `navigation`, `lifecycle`, `network`, `state`, `render`
- Ring buffer on agent (last 1000 events per device)
- Injected into fix prompts via `GenerateBlackBoxContext()`
- Fatal crashes auto-create fix tasks
- `/blackbox/subscribe` SSE for live log watching

### Remote Reload (agent command channel)
The BlackBox SSE connection doubles as a **command channel** from agent to SDK. When the vibe coder triggers a reload from the Yaver mobile app (or from the Feedback SDK's "Hot Reload" button), the agent broadcasts the command to all connected SDK sessions.

**Use case:** Both the Yaver mobile app and a third-party app (with Feedback SDK) are connected to the same Go agent. The vibe coder can trigger reload of the third-party app while away from their desk.

```
Yaver Mobile App ──POST /dev/reload-app──► Agent ──SSE command──► Third-Party App (SDK)
                                            │                        ├─ onReload()
                                            └─ BroadcastCommand()    └─ DevSettings.reload()
```

**Two reload modes:**
- `"dev"` — Hot reload: tells the dev server to restart, SDK calls `onReload` callback (default: `DevSettings.reload()`)
- `"bundle"` — Native bundle: rebuilds Hermes bytecode, pushes `reload_bundle` command with bundle URL

**Agent endpoints:**
- `POST /dev/reload` — Existing hot reload + now also broadcasts to SDK sessions
- `POST /dev/reload-app` — Explicit reload with mode selection (`{"mode": "dev"}` or `{"mode": "bundle"}`)
- `GET /blackbox/command-stream` — SSE-only endpoint for receiving commands (lightweight, no event ingestion)

**SDK API:**
- `FeedbackConfig.onReload` / `onReloadBundle` — Callbacks invoked on reload commands
- `BlackBox.onCommand(handler)` — Register custom command handlers, returns unsubscribe function
- `BlackBox.isCommandChannelConnected` — Check if SSE command channel is connected
- `P2PClient.reloadApp(mode)` — Trigger reload from SDK code (`'dev'` or `'bundle'`)

## Multi-User Mode (Shared Machines)

Shared CPU/GPU machines support multiple users with isolated workspaces. Each user authenticates with their own OAuth account (Apple/Google/Microsoft) — no shared passwords, no SSH keys.

### How it works
1. Machine starts with `yaver serve --multi-user --team <teamId>`
2. Team member connects from Yaver app → token validated against Convex → team membership checked
3. `MultiUserManager` creates isolated `UserSession` at `/var/yaver/users/yaver-{userId[:8]}/`
4. Each user gets: own workspace, task queue, feedback reports, AI agent sessions, black box streams
5. GPU resources (Ollama, PersonaPlex) shared across all users

### Team Management
- Teams managed via Convex: `teams` + `teamMembers` tables
- Admin creates team, invites members by email
- Endpoints: `POST /teams`, `POST /teams/members`, `GET /teams/validate`
- Agent validates team membership on every request via `GET /auth/validate` (returns `teams[]`)

### Key Files

yaver serve --multi-user --team team_abc  # Restrict to team members
yaver serve --multi-user --max-users 10   # Limit concurrent users
```

## Account Linking & Merge

A Yaver user can hold **multiple OAuth identities** (Apple + Google + Microsoft + email) on the same account, and can fold two Yaver accounts into one if they accidentally signed up twice. All operations surface through web, mobile, CLI, and MCP — fully symmetric.

### Identity model
- `authIdentities` table (`backend/convex/schema.ts`) stores `(userId, provider, providerId)` tuples. One user can have many rows.
- `users` table still holds a "primary" `(provider, providerId)` for legacy lookups; when that primary identity is unlinked, another linked identity is auto-promoted.
- OAuth sign-in resolves via `findUserForOAuth()`: `authIdentities` index first, then primary on `users`, then email. Signing in with any linked provider always lands on the same account.

### HTTP surface (all at Convex site)
| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/auth/providers` | GET | list identities for current session |
| `/auth/oauth-link/start` | POST | mint a 15-min link intent |
| `/auth/oauth-link/complete` | POST | OAuth callback completes it |
| `/auth/oauth-link/:provider` | DELETE | unlink (refuses last one, refuses stale TOTP) |
| `/auth/account/merge/start` | POST | mint a 30-min merge intent; target is the caller's account |
| `/auth/account/merge/status` | GET (public, token is secret) | for the approval page |
| `/auth/account/merge/complete` | POST | source session approves + executes |
| `/auth/account/merge/cancel` | POST | target cancels before approval |

### Security envelope (every destructive auth op)
- **TOTP re-verification** when `users.totpEnabled` — unlink, `createAccountMergeIntent`, and `completeAccountMerge` (source side) all require a fresh 6-digit code (or a recovery code, which is consumed). Without it they fail with `TOTP_REQUIRED` → HTTP 412.
- **Rate limit** on merge intents: max 3 pending + max 10 per hour per user.
- **Security events** — every link/unlink/merge writes a row to `securityEvents` with `eventType` ∈ {`link_added`, `link_removed`, `merge_started`, `merge_completed`, `merge_cancelled`}.
- **Security emails** sent via Resend on every action. Templates in `backend/convex/email.ts`: `providerLinkedHtml`, `providerUnlinkedHtml`, `accountsMergedHtml`, `mergeStartedHtml`. Merge also courtesy-emails the deleted address.
- **Unlink of `email` provider** clears `users.passwordHash` when it was the last email identity, so password login actually stops working.

### Manual merge flow
1. Target (keeps data) calls `/auth/account/merge/start` from their session → receives `{mergeToken, approvalUrl, expiresAt}`. Approval URL is `https://yaver.io/account/merge?token=<mergeToken>`.
2. Target shares the URL out-of-band (or opens it on another browser).
3. Source (will be deleted) signs in on that browser, the page loads `/account/merge?token=...`, confirms target email, user approves.
4. `/auth/account/merge/complete` validates both sessions + (if source has 2FA) `sourceTotpCode`, then runs `mergeUserInto(source, target)`.

### `mergeUserInto` coverage (all user-keyed tables)
Sessions, devices, userSettings, developerSurveys, subscriptions, managedRelays, cloudMachines, sdkTokens, securityEvents, authLogs, userProjects, userServices, userDeployments, userActivity, runnerUsage, dailyTaskCounts, teams (owner), teamMembers (deduping + role upgrade on collision, invitedBy rewrite), guestInvitations (+ optional guestUserId), guestAccess, guestUsage, infraAccessGrants + Devices + Machines, authIdentities. Ephemeral tables (passwordResets, pendingAuth, oauthLinkIntents) are deleted; source-owned merge intents are cleaned up so the source user row can be deleted cleanly.

### Surfaces

| Interface | Link | Unlink | Merge | List |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Web** | Settings → Sign-In Methods → Connect | per-row Unlink button | Merge another account card + `/account/merge` approval page | identity list in Settings |
| **Mobile** | Settings → Sign-In Methods → Connect | per-row Unlink pill | Start merge card (shows URL) | identity list in Settings |
| **CLI** | `yaver account link <provider>` | `yaver account unlink <provider> [--totp x]` | `yaver account merge start [--totp x]` → approval URL | `yaver account providers` |
| **MCP** | `yaver_auth_link_start` + `yaver_auth_link_wait` | `yaver_auth_unlink` | `yaver_auth_merge_start` + `yaver_auth_merge_wait` | `yaver_auth_list_identities` |

### Deep-link return (mobile)
The OAuth callback route (`web/app/api/auth/oauth/[provider]/callback/route.ts`) redirects to `yaver://oauth-callback?linked=1&linkedProvider=<provider>` when `state.client === "mobile"` and `state.intent === "link"`. Settings tab listens for that URL and immediately refreshes + toasts "X linked to this Yaver account."

## Guest Access (Share Your Machine)

Let other people use your machine through Yaver without giving them SSH, passwords, or team setup. The host invites a guest by email; the guest accepts from the Yaver mobile app and can then run tasks on the host's agent. No team or subscription required — just OAuth identity + consent.

### How it works
1. **Host** invites: `yaver guests invite cousin@gmail.com` → gets a 6-char invite code (e.g. `K7WP3N`)
2. **Guest** downloads Yaver app → signs in with **any OAuth method** (Apple, Google, Microsoft, or email)
3. **Acceptance** — two paths:
   - **Email match**: If guest signs in with the same email that was invited, they see the invitation automatically and tap "Accept"
   - **Invite code**: If guest signs in with a different email (e.g. Apple private relay, different OAuth provider), they enter the 6-char invite code
4. Guest's device list now shows the host's machine(s) — labeled as "(hostname) (host name)"
5. Guest can create tasks, use feedback, dev server, vibing — but NOT shell, vault, sessions, or terminals
6. **Host** revokes anytime: `yaver guests remove cousin@gmail.com`

### Pre-Registration Support
Invitations work even if the guest **doesn't have a Yaver account yet**:
- Host invites `cousin@gmail.com` → invitation stored in Convex with 2-day TTL
- Guest downloads Yaver app days later → signs up → sees invitation (if within 2 days)
- Alternatively, host shares the invite code out-of-band (text, WhatsApp, etc.) → guest enters it after signing up
- The CLI tells the host whether the invited email is already registered

### OAuth Compatibility
Guests can sign in with **any** supported OAuth provider — they don't need to use the same provider as the host:
- **Google Sign-In** — real email
- **Apple Sign-In** — Apple returns real email in the identity token (even with "Hide My Email")
- **Microsoft/Office 365** — real email
- **Email/password** — exact email match
- **Cross-provider**: Host invites `cousin@gmail.com`, guest signs in with Apple using same underlying email → **auto-match works**
- **Different email**: Host invites `cousin@gmail.com`, guest signs in with `cousin@outlook.com` → use the **invite code** to accept

### Constraints
- **Max 5 guests** per host
- **Invitations expire in 2 days** if not accepted
- **Only the host can invite** — guests cannot invite other guests
- **Scoped access** — guests are restricted to safe endpoints (see table below)
- **Invite code**: 6-char uppercase alphanumeric (no 0/O/1/I to avoid confusion)

### Guest Endpoint Access

| Allowed (Guest)  | Blocked (Host Only) |
|------------------|---------------------|
| `/tasks`, `/tasks/` | `/exec`, `/exec/` |
| `/feedback`, `/feedback/` | `/vault/*` |
| `/dev/*` | `/session/*` |
| `/blackbox/*` | `/tmux/*` |
| `/voice/*` | `/agent/shutdown`, `/agent/clean` |
| `/info`, `/agent/status`, `/agent/runners` | `/git/*` |
| `/projects`, `/todolist`, `/builds` | `/repos/*` |
| `/vibing`, `/vibing/*` | `/schedules`, `/notifications/*` |
| `/health`, `/guests` | `/users`, `/sessions` |

### How the Agent Enforces Guest Access
1. Agent polls `GET /guests/allowed` from Convex every 60 seconds → caches approved guest userIds
2. When a non-owner token arrives, `auth()` middleware checks if userId is in the guest list
3. If yes, checks if the requested path is in `guestAllowedPrefixes` — allows or rejects
4. Sets `X-Yaver-Guest: true` and `X-Yaver-GuestUserID` headers on allowed requests
5. On revocation, agent clears token cache so the guest is rejected within 60 seconds

### Guest Config (Resource Limits & Access Control)

Hosts can configure per-guest limits. Config is stored in Convex (synced via agent polling every 60s). Project access is P2P-only (stored locally on the agent).

**Config fields (Convex — synced):**
| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `dailyTokenLimit` | number | unlimited | Max task-seconds per day |
| `allowedRunners` | string[] | all | Which AI runners guest can use |
| `usageMode` | string | `always` | `always`, `idle-only`, `scheduled` |
| `schedule` | object | none | `{ startHour, endHour, timezone? }` for scheduled mode |

**Project access (P2P — local):**
| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `allowedProjects` | string[] | all | Project paths guest can access |

**Enforcement:** The `GuestConfigManager` caches configs and checks them in `allowGuest()` before every guest request. Usage is tracked locally (ring buffer) and flushed to Convex every 60 seconds.

### Guest Config CLI

## Hybrid Mode (Planner + Local Implementer)

Pair an expensive frontier model as the **planner** with a cheap local model as the **implementer** to cut API spend on a feature-building loop by one to two orders of magnitude. The planner (Claude Code / Codex / OpenCode) decomposes the user goal into narrow, file-scoped subtasks; each subtask is executed by Aider driving a local Ollama model (default `qwen2.5-coder:14b`, fits 24 GB RAM).

### How it works
1. `yaver hybrid "<feature>"` (or `POST /hybrid/run`) builds a `plannerPrompt` that explicitly tells the planner the implementer is a small local model with no reasoning and a tiny context, and demands hyper-explicit per-file subtasks with acceptance criteria.
2. Planner returns `{"subtasks":[{title, files, prompt}, ...]}`.
3. Orchestrator loops through subtasks, invoking Aider with `--model ollama_chat/qwen2.5-coder:14b` and `OLLAMA_API_BASE=http://127.0.0.1:11434`. Files named by the planner become aider's editable set.
4. Subtask failures are recorded but do not abort the run — caller decides whether to retry, re-plan, or accept partial output.

### CLI
```bash
yaver hybrid --check                                    # preflight: aider + ollama + model
yaver hybrid --planner claude --implementer aider-ollama \
  --model ollama_chat/qwen2.5-coder:14b "<feature prompt>"
yaver hybrid --json "<feature prompt>" > report.json    # full HybridReport
```

### HTTP
- `POST /hybrid/plan` — plan only (preview subtasks, no edits)
- `POST /hybrid/run` — plan + execute, returns `HybridReport`

Both are behind the normal owner-auth middleware; guests are blocked (planners see the whole repo).

### Key files
| File | Purpose |

### Installing dependencies
```bash
yaver install hybrid    # ollama + aider + pull qwen2.5-coder:14b (meta-target)
# or individually:
yaver install aider
yaver install opencode
yaver install ollama
```

### Cost intuition
Planner output is ~1 % of total tokens in a hybrid run; the bulk goes to the implementer which is free. Against pure Claude Code, expect 80-95 % API-cost reduction on feature loops where the planner's decomposition survives without mid-run replanning. See the session notes for worked numbers.

## Autodev / Loop — Self-Heal & Live Streaming

`yaver autodev` and `yaver loop` are CLI front-ends that talk to the local daemon over `http://127.0.0.1:18080`. Two robustness layers wrap that conversation:

### Self-healing daemon calls
`localAgentRequest` (`desktop/agent/session_cmd.go`) detects transport-level failures (daemon not running, connection refused, deadline exceeded) and transparently:
1. Spawns `yaver serve` in the background (detached, logs to `~/.yaver/agent.log`).
2. Polls `/health` for up to 10 s.
3. Retries the original request once.

So the user never has to manually `yaver serve` after a daemon crash, machine reboot before launchd kicked in, or upgrade. Auth-missing errors are surfaced as-is — re-pairing requires the mobile flow, which can't be automated.

### Live log streams (`/streams/{name}`)
`desktop/agent/logstream.go` adds a daemon-hosted, named log-channel registry. Each stream is a small in-memory ring buffer (last 500 lines) plus a non-blocking subscriber fan-out — slow consumers drop, the producer never stalls.

HTTP surface (auth'd):
- `GET /streams` — list active stream names.
- `GET /streams/{name}` — SSE subscribe. Server replays the history snapshot first, then streams live `{"type":"line","text":"..."}` events with a 20 s keepalive ping.
- `POST /streams/{name}/append` — `{"line":"..."}` or `{"lines":["..."]}`.

`yaver autodev` / `yaver autotest` automatically tee `os.Stdout` and `os.Stderr` through `teeStdoutToStream` (`desktop/agent/autodev_stream.go`) so every line — including subprocess output from the AI runner — appears both in the terminal and on `streams/autodev:<loop-name>`. The mobile app and web dashboard subscribe via `EventSource` to watch the run live, exactly like the user sees it. If the daemon is unreachable the tee silently degrades to terminal-only output; the autodev loop is never blocked by streaming.

### Engine selector (`--engine claude|hybrid`)
`yaver autodev` exposes a high-level engine knob so you don't have to think about runner names:
- `--engine claude` (default, also `--engine claude-code`) — uses `claude-code` end-to-end. Frontier model writes the code directly. Highest quality, highest cost.
- `--engine hybrid` (or `--hybrid` shortcut) — sets `runner=hybrid`. Each kick: Claude plans (≤5 file-scoped subtasks), local Aider+Ollama (`qwen2.5-coder:14b` by default) implements. ~80–95 % cheaper on feature loops; quality varies with the local model.

`runner=hybrid` is implemented in `desktop/agent/loop_exec_hybrid.go` (`spawnHybrid` → `RunHybrid` → `AIResponse`), with preflight checks for `claude` + `aider` + `ollama` in `loop_cmd.go`. Existing `--runner` overrides still work for direct selection of any single runner (`claude-code`, `codex`, `aider`, `aider-ollama`, `ollama:<model>`).

### Key files
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `desktop/agent/session_cmd.go` | `localAgentRequest` + `ensureDaemonAlive` |
| `desktop/agent/logstream.go` | `LogStream`, `LogStreamRegistry`, SSE handlers |
| `desktop/agent/autodev_stream.go` | `streamPublisher`, `teeStdoutToStream` |
| `desktop/agent/stream_cmd.go` | `yaver stream <name>` SSE tail |
| `desktop/agent/autodev_cmd.go` | tee hook + `--engine` + `--auto-ideas` flags |
| `desktop/agent/autodev_ideas.go` | `autodevRefillIdeas` (Claude-driven checklist refill) |
| `desktop/agent/loop_exec_hybrid.go` | `spawnHybrid` adapter (planner+implementer per kick) |
| `desktop/agent/autodev_options_http.go` | `GET /autodev/options` capability discovery |
| `desktop/agent/autodev_reports_http.go` | `POST /autodev/start` accepts `engine` + `auto_ideas` |

### Auto-ideas refill, live subprocess output, capability discovery
Three follow-ons that round out the autodev UX:

1. **`--auto-ideas N`** (default 1): when `remained.md` empties, autodev asks Claude to append 5 fresh `- [ ]` items and keeps going. `0` restores the old "exit when checklist empty" behaviour. Owned by `autodev_ideas.go`.
2. **Live subprocess output**: `spawnClaudeCode` / `spawnCodex` / `spawnAider` tee subprocess stdout to `os.Stderr` (then on through the daemon stream) while still capturing it for `parseAIResponse`. The user sees Claude's work in real time instead of staring at a silent terminal for minutes.
3. **`GET /autodev/options`**: mobile / web / MCP discover what the *remote* dev machine supports. Returns `engines[]` (`claude` + `hybrid` with `available` + `missing`), `runners[]`, and `defaults` (`engine=claude`, `hours=8`, `load=lite`, `auto_ideas=1`, `no_autotest=false`). MCP tool `autodev_options` returns the same payload. `autodev_start` (HTTP + MCP) accepts `engine` + `auto_ideas` so all three surfaces share one contract.

## Pass Session to Yaver (Handoff)

`yaver handoff` lets a user — or an AI agent itself, via the `session_handoff` MCP tool — hand an in-progress session over to Yaver's autodev loop. Yaver imports the session, stops the source task (if it's a Yaver task), spins up a develop-mode loop with the chosen engine/runner, and starts kicking. Works locally, against a remote dev box (`--to <device>`), with hybrid mode, or with any single runner.

### Surfaces (all share the same args)

| Surface | Invocation |
|---------|------------|
| CLI | `yaver handoff [--from X] [--to D] [--engine claude\|hybrid\|runner] [--runner R] [--workdir .] [--max-kicks N] [--deadline S] [--message ...] [--stop-source]` |
| MCP | tool `session_handoff` with the same fields (snake_case) |
| HTTP | `POST /session/handoff` with `HandoffSpec` JSON |

All flags optional. `yaver handoff` with no args = "take over the current cwd with claude-code, kick it".

### Engine selector

| Engine | Resolved runner | Notes |
|--------|----------------|-------|
| `claude` (default) | `claude-code` | Frontier model end-to-end |
| `hybrid` | `hybrid` (planner=claude, implementer=aider+ollama) | Routes through `loop_exec_hybrid.go::spawnHybrid` |
| `runner` | value of `--runner` | Any runner id: `aider`, `codex`, `ollama:qwen2.5-coder:14b`, etc. |
| anything else | passed through verbatim | Forward-compat for new runner ids |

### Sentinel file (graceful source-agent exit)

External AI agents (Claude Code CLI, etc.) can't be force-killed by Yaver. Instead, the orchestrator writes:

- `~/.yaver/handoff/<loopName>.json` — `HandoffSentinel` JSON with `loopName`, `localTaskId`, `runner`, `writtenAt`, `message`
- `~/.yaver/handoff/latest.json` — stable pointer to the most recent sentinel

The MCP tool also returns `exitNow: true` in its response so an agent that reads its own MCP results can self-terminate immediately. Use the file as a fallback for agents that ignore the field.

### Orchestrator flow (`desktop/agent/handoff.go::RunHandoff`)

1. Resolve source → `TransferBundle` (export Yaver task / read session file / use pre-built `SourceBundle`).
2. `ImportSession` into local `TaskManager`.
3. If `StopSource` and source is a Yaver task → `tm.StopTask(sourceID)`.
4. Build `LoopSpec{Mode: develop, Think.Runner: <resolved>, Think.PromptInline: <synthesised resume prompt>}`. Target auto-detected (`ios-sim` if `mobile/ios/` present, else `web`) — needed only because `validateLoopSpec` requires it.
5. Persist via `saveLoops`.
6. Write sentinel.
7. Async `kickLoopOnce` so the first iteration starts immediately.

The resume prompt is built from: bundle title + agent type + turn count + pending `TodoListManager` items (top 20) + caller `ExtraPrompt`. We never parse the chat transcript with regex — the new runner re-plans from imported context if needed.

### Remote handoff

`yaver handoff --to <device>` exports the source bundle on the local daemon (via `/session/export`), then POSTs the `HandoffSpec` (with `SourceBundle` populated) to the target's `/session/handoff`. The target re-enters `RunHandoff` with the bundle pre-supplied — no second export needed. Remote handoff is intentionally not exposed via MCP (the calling agent rarely has the right device context); use the CLI for cross-machine handoff.

### Key files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `desktop/agent/handoff.go` | `HandoffSpec`, `HandoffResult`, `HandoffSentinel`, `RunHandoff`, prompt builder, sentinel writer |
| `desktop/agent/handoff_cmd.go` | `yaver handoff` CLI; local + remote paths |
| `desktop/agent/transfer.go` | `ImportOptions` extended with `Handoff*` fields (forward-compat) |

| `desktop/agent/mcp_tools.go` | `session_handoff` tool schema |
| `desktop/agent/main.go` | CLI dispatch case `handoff` |

## Project context files for autonomous yaver sessions

When `yaver autodev` / `yaver autoideas` / `yaver autotest` runs, the runner's prompt is prepended with cached context drawn from three files at the project root (best-effort — missing files just contribute nothing):

| File | Purpose | How it gets there |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| `init.md` | Auto-generated project description: stack, layout, conventions, build/test/deploy commands, recent direction, plus an auto-appended history of what each yaver run shipped. | `yaver autoinit <project>` (CLI / `POST /autoinit/start` / MCP `autoinit_start`). Status: `yaver autoinit status` / `GET /autoinit/status` / MCP `autoinit_status`. |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Hand-written project conventions, terminology rules, deploy notes, copyright/legal rules. The repo's source of truth for "how a coding agent should behave here". | Manual (you write it). |
| `remained.md` | Markdown checklist (`- [ ] item`) of what's left to build. autodev's default driver — each kick picks the next unchecked item, implements it, checks it off, commits. autoideas appends to it. | Optional. autodev auto-detects `remained.md` / `REMAINED.md` / `TODO.md` if present. |

The runner prompt opens with these three sections under a `--- CACHED PROJECT CONTEXT ---` banner so it doesn't have to re-grep / re-read the project on every kick. Each file is capped at 8 KB inside the prompt to protect the context window.

**Run `yaver autoinit` once when adopting a new project** — the wall-clock + token cost of every subsequent autodev / autoideas / autotest kick drops sharply because Claude reads cached context instead of grepping the codebase from scratch.

## Engine selection (claude vs codex vs hybrid)

`yaver autodev` / `yaver autoinit` / `yaver autoideas` / `yaver autotest` all accept the same `--engine` flag and the matching `engine` field over HTTP / MCP. The choice has real cost/throughput consequences:

| Engine | When to use | Why |
|--------|-------------|-----|
| `claude` (default) | High-stakes commits, complex refactors, architecture work, anything where being right matters more than throughput. | Highest quality (~67% win rate vs Codex in blind tests, 80.9% SWE-bench). Strongest at long-context reasoning. |
| `codex` (also `--codex`) | Daily-volume work, autonomous DevOps, anything you'd run for hours overnight. Switch here when your Claude Max weekly bucket is depleted. | ~4× fewer tokens per task → ~4× more headroom on equivalent plans. Leads Terminal-Bench 2.0 (77.3%). Slightly lower code quality but actually usable when limits matter. |
| `hybrid` (also `--hybrid`) | Long unattended runs where you want to amortise a planner call across many small implementations. | Claude plans up to 5 file-scoped subtasks per kick, local Aider+Ollama implements them. ~80–95 % cheaper than pure Claude. Quality varies with the local model. |

A useful pattern (community consensus from Apr 2026): "Codex for keystrokes, Claude Code for commits" — daily volume on Codex, high-stakes changes on Claude Code. With yaver this maps to: `yaver autoideas --engine codex` to keep the queue full overnight, then `yaver autodev --engine claude` against the curated subset for the actual implementation.

The mobile / web `Auto Dev` start form pulls `/autodev/options` to grey out engines whose CLIs aren't installed, so users never pick a runner the machine can't satisfy.

## Opex transparency (`--model`, opex log lines, `/autodev/cost`)

Claude Max plans share a weekly bucket across Opus + Sonnet, and Opus
burns it ~5× faster. Default to Sonnet for routine autodev work and
escalate to Opus only for planning / hard bugs.

- **CLI flag:** `yaver autodev sfmg --model sonnet` (also `opus` /
  `haiku`, or a full id like `claude-opus-4-6`).
- **Mechanism:** sets `YAVER_CLAUDE_MODEL` env var; `spawnClaudeCode`
  resolves the alias and passes `--model <id>` to Claude Code.
- **Per-kick cost line:** every Claude `result` event prints
  `[claude] result: success (12.3s, $0.0123)` followed by
  `[opex] kick this run: $0.0123 — total: $0.456 across 12 kicks`.
- **End-of-run summary:** autodev prints `opex summary — $X
  spent across N kicks (avg $Y/kick)` before exit.
- **HTTP `/autodev/cost`:** returns `{total_usd, kicks,
  avg_usd_per_kick}` so mobile / web can show a live opex meter
  during a run.

Future work (in `remained.md`): true planner/implementer split
within Claude (`opus` plans, `sonnet` implements per kick) for users
who want the article's "Codex for keystrokes, Claude Code for
commits" pattern but using only Anthropic.

## Hybrid layering (`--planner` + `--implementer`)

Hybrid mode now exposes the two tiers separately so a user can compose any agent×model pair per role. Default is unchanged: no tier flags = single-engine end-to-end (the user's `--engine` choice).

| Tier | Flag | Accepted values |
|------|------|-----------------|
| Planner | `--planner agent[:model]` | `claude` · `claude:opus` · `claude:sonnet` · `codex` |
| Implementer | `--implementer agent[:model]` | `claude` · `claude:sonnet` · `claude:opus` · `codex` · `aider-ollama` · `aider-ollama:<ollama-model>` |

Either flag set forces `--engine hybrid`. `splitAgentSpec` parses the `agent:model` form, expanding `sonnet` / `opus` / `haiku` aliases to current 4.6/4.5 ids; full ids and Ollama models pass through verbatim.

Example layerings (the user picks the cost/quality split):

| Use case | Command |
|----------|---------|
| Default — no split | `yaver autodev sfmg` |
| Cheap volume, premium plan | `yaver autodev sfmg --planner claude:opus --implementer claude:sonnet` |
| Token-efficient implementation | `yaver autodev sfmg --planner claude:opus --implementer codex` |
| Free implementation, paid planning | `yaver autodev sfmg --planner claude:opus --implementer aider-ollama` |
| Bug fix (highest stakes both tiers) | `yaver autodev sfmg --planner claude:opus --implementer claude:opus --max-iterations 1 --prompt "fix the auth race"` |
| Daily volume, no Anthropic spend | `yaver autodev sfmg --planner codex --implementer codex` |

Mechanism: `autodev_cmd` sets `YAVER_HYBRID_PLANNER` / `YAVER_HYBRID_IMPLEMENTER` env vars; `spawnHybrid` reads them and overrides `HybridSpec.Planner` / `Implementer` / `Model`. The runners themselves are dispatched via `runImplementer` against `builtinRunners` so adding a new agent just means adding it to that map.

## Container Sandbox (Optional Task Isolation)

Run AI agent tasks inside Docker containers for filesystem isolation. **Optional and disabled by default** — the default mode runs tasks directly on the host (unchanged behavior).

### How it works
1. Host builds the sandbox image: `yaver sandbox build` (~3 min, one-time)
2. Host enables containerization via CLI flags or config
3. Tasks run inside `yaver-sandbox` Docker containers with the project dir mounted as `/workspace`
4. Build caches (npm, Gradle, Cargo, Go) persist via Docker named volumes
5. Only API keys needed by AI agents are injected (not the full host environment)

### Config

```bash
# CLI flags
yaver serve --containerize-guests    # Guest tasks only
yaver serve --containerize-host      # All tasks

# Or in ~/.yaver/config.json
{
  "containerize_guests": true,
  "containerize_host": false,
  "container_cpu": "2.0",
  "container_memory": "4g",
  "container_image": "yaver-sandbox",
  "container_mounts": ["/opt/android-sdk:/opt/android-sdk:ro"]
}
```

### Build system support

| Build Tool | Container Support | Notes |
|-----------|:-:|-------|
| Gradle (Android) | Yes | Java pre-installed, Gradle wrapper downloads SDK on demand |
| npm / Expo / Vite | Yes | Node.js 22 pre-installed |
| Go | Yes | Go 1.22 pre-installed |
| Rust / Cargo | Yes | Stable toolchain pre-installed |
| Python / pip | Yes | Python 3 pre-installed |
| **Xcode (iOS)** | **No** | Requires macOS — use direct execution for iOS builds |
| Vercel CLI | Yes | Pre-installed |
| Flutter | Optional | Uncomment in Dockerfile or use project-level `Dockerfile.yaver` |

### Project-specific containers
Place a `Dockerfile.yaver` in your project root. The agent auto-detects it and builds a `yaver-project-<dirname>` image.

### Guest task security layers (with containers)

| Layer | Without Container | With Container |
|-------|:-:|:-:|
| Prompt prefix (AI instructions) | Yes | Yes |
| Workdir pinning | Yes | Yes |
| Endpoint allowlist | Yes | Yes |
| Custom command block | Yes | Yes |
| **Filesystem isolation** | No | **Yes** (Docker namespace) |
| **Environment isolation** | No | **Yes** (only API keys injected) |
| Runner restriction | Yes | Yes |
| Daily limits + schedule | Yes | Yes |

### Key Files
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `desktop/agent/Dockerfile.sandbox` | Sandbox Docker image definition |
| `desktop/agent/container_runner.go` | `ContainerRunner`: Docker wrapper for task execution |
| `desktop/agent/sandbox_cmd.go` | CLI: `yaver sandbox build\|status` |
| `desktop/agent/sandbox_http.go` | HTTP: `/sandbox/status`, `/sandbox/config`, `/sandbox/build` |
| `desktop/agent/config.go` | Config fields: `containerize_guests`, `containerize_host`, `container_*` |

## Remote Support Sessions (TeamViewer-style)

`yaver support` opens a short-lived, in-memory, owner-initiated window that lets a trusted second party (a guest's phone, a web browser, another Yaver agent) reach a scoped subset of this agent's HTTP API — terminal, exec, file browse, browser sessions, system status — until the host stops it or the TTL expires. Nothing is persisted; nothing touches Convex. This is deliberately distinct from the Convex-backed Guest Access above: guest grants are long-lived and email-tied, support sessions are transient and code-tied.

### Scope (allowlist)

| Allowed (Support bearer) | Blocked (Owner only) |
|--------------------------|----------------------|
| `/health`, `/info`, `/agent/{status,capabilities,runners}` | `/vault/*` |
| `/files/{roots,list,read,raw}` | `/tasks`, `/session/*` |
| `/exec`, `/exec/` | `/agent/shutdown` |
| `/ws/terminal` | `/autodev/*` |
| `/browser/`, `/streams`, `/streams/` | `/schedules`, `/notifications/*` |
| `/support/` (self-management) | anything else not in the left column |

The session sets an `X-Yaver-Support: true` header on allowed requests so downstream handlers can log / audit accordingly. An expired or revoked bearer hits the same 401/403 any unknown token does.

### How it flows

```

### Endpoint table

| Endpoint | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /support/start` | owner | open a session; returns code + bearer + shareable URLs |
| `POST /support/stop`  | owner | revoke the active session immediately |
| `GET  /support/status`| owner | full state incl. code + bearer (for the host's own UI) |
| `GET  /support/info`  | none (rate-limited) | `{active, host, expiresAt, allowed}` — no secrets |
| `POST /support/redeem`| none (rate-limited) | exchange code for bearer |

### CLI

```bash
yaver support start  --ttl 30m --label "cousin"   # open a window
yaver support status                               # code + time left
yaver support stop                                 # revoke
yaver support connect https://relay.yaver.io/d/abc123 K7WP3N   # interactive REPL
yaver support connect http://10.0.0.5:18080 ABCD23 "uname -a"  # one-shot exec
yaver ui --local --code K7WP3N                     # open the embedded console
yaver ui --hosted --device abc123 --code K7WP3N    # open yaver.io/support
```

### Surfaces

| Interface | Start | Redeem | Connect |
|-----------|-------|--------|---------|
| **CLI** | `yaver support start` | `yaver support connect <url> <CODE>` | interactive REPL via `/exec` polling |
| **Web** | (owner UI, TBD) | `yaver.io/support?agent=<base>&code=<CODE>` | in-browser fetch → exec + files |
| **Agent-embedded** | N/A | `http://<agent>/app/?support=<CODE>` | same HTML as fallback, served by the agent |
| **MCP** | `support_start` | N/A (agents use `support_status` to fetch bearer directly) | via `support_status` + `exec` |
| **Agent HTTP** | `POST /support/start` | `POST /support/redeem` | bearer-authed `/exec`, `/ws/terminal`, `/files/*` |

### Security model
- Code is 6 chars from the pair alphabet (no 0/O/1/I). 1 in ~1.3B to brute force, and the whole flow is behind `s.rateLimit`.
- Bearer is `yv_supp_` + 24 random bytes (base64 URL). The `auth()` middleware short-circuits on the prefix so Convex is never touched.
- Session lives only in the host's process memory. Agent restart, `yaver support stop`, or TTL expiry all revoke it immediately.
- The guest's bearer is kept in memory on their side too (console fallback + `/support` page both refuse to write to localStorage). Close the tab = end the guest's access.

### Key files

## SDK Token Security

The Feedback SDK uses a dedicated token system with defense-in-depth security:

### Token Types
- **CLI session token**: Used by `yaver serve`, short-lived, full agent access
- **SDK token**: Long-lived (configurable), scoped to feedback endpoints only, independent from CLI session
- CLI reauth does NOT invalidate SDK tokens (they are separate sessions in Convex)

### 6 Security Layers

| Layer | What | How |
|-------|------|-----|
| **Scope restriction** | SDK tokens limited to feedback/blackbox/voice/builds | `authSDK()` middleware checks path against token scopes |
| **IP binding** | Token restricted to specific networks | `allowedCIDRs` field on sdkTokens, checked per-request |
| **Agent IP allowlist** | Block all external IPs | `--allow-ips` flag, outer middleware before auth |
| **Token rotation** | Rotate without downtime | `POST /sdk/token/rotate`, 5-min grace period |
| **New device alerts** | Detect token use from new IPs | `seenIPs` tracking, events sent to Convex |
| **HTTPS on LAN** | Encrypt LAN traffic | Self-signed TLS cert, port 18443, fingerprint in beacon |

### Auth Middleware Architecture
```
Request → ipAllowlist → CORS → auth()/authSDK()

## Phone-First Mini Backend

Phone-first projects let a user create a backend from the Yaver mobile app (or web dashboard) without provisioning any real infra first. Each project is a SQLite-backed Yaver project stored at `~/.yaver/phone-projects/<slug>/` with a portable, declarative manifest — promotable to any of the 19 switch-engine targets (Convex, Supabase, Postgres/Neon, Turso, etc.) with the existing 7-day rollback window. See `MOBILE_WORKER.md` §213-419 for the product spec.

### Layout

```
~/.yaver/phone-projects/<slug>/
  .yaver/
    config.yaml    # backend: sqlite (picks up existing /backend/* routes)
    project.yaml   # declarative ProjectManifest (yaver apply)
    phone.yaml     # phone-specific metadata (name, template, timestamps)
  schema.yaml      # portable schema DSL (tables/columns/indexes/relations)
  auth.yaml        # persona list (mock-auth)
  seed.json        # fixture rows keyed by table
  local.db         # SQLite file (driver: modernc.org/sqlite, no CGO)
  storage/         # local blob storage
```

### Portability contract (enforced by schema DSL)

Column types are limited to the intersection of SQLite / Postgres / Convex: `text · int · bool · real · timestamp · json · uuid`. Defaults are `uuid · now · <literal>`. The export bundle includes `schema.sql` (SQLite) and `schema.postgres.sql` (Postgres) so a non-Yaver environment can also import the project.

### Endpoints (all owner-auth, not guest-accessible)

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/phone/projects/list` | GET | List all phone projects |
| `/phone/projects/templates` | GET | List built-in templates (blank/crud/todos/notes) |
| `/phone/projects/create` | POST | `{name, slug?, template?, schema?, auth?, seed?}` — create + materialize |
| `/phone/projects/get?slug=X` | GET | Full project (schema + auth + seed + live stats) |
| `/phone/projects/delete` | POST | `{slug}` — rm -rf the project dir |
| `/phone/projects/schema` | GET/POST | Read / additive-apply PhoneSchema |
| `/phone/projects/auth` | POST | Write auth.yaml + mirror into users table if present |
| `/phone/projects/seed` | POST | INSERT OR REPLACE seed rows |
| `/phone/projects/tables` | GET | ListTables over the project's SQLite |
| `/phone/projects/browse?slug=X&table=Y` | GET | Paginated rows |
| `/phone/projects/insert` | POST | `{slug, table, doc}` |
| `/phone/projects/update` | POST | `{slug, table, id, fields}` |
| `/phone/projects/delete-row` | POST | `{slug, table, id}` |
| `/phone/projects/query` | POST | Raw SQL (SELECT/UPDATE/etc.) |
| `/phone/projects/export?slug=X` | GET | tgz bundle (.yaver/, schema.yaml, auth.yaml, seed.json, schema.sql, README.md) |
| `/phone/projects/promote` | POST | `{slug, target, run?, dryRun?}` — wraps SwitchEngine.Plan/Run with 7-day snapshot |

The existing `/backend/*`, `/manifest/*`, `/switch/*` endpoints also work against a phone project when passed `?directory=~/.yaver/phone-projects/<slug>` — the only difference is the Mac-Mini-hosted vs. project-root location of the SQLite file.

### MCP tools (for AI agents)

`phone_project_list · phone_project_templates · phone_project_create · phone_project_get · phone_project_delete · phone_project_schema · phone_project_seed · phone_project_export · phone_project_promote`. Registered in `desktop/agent/mcp_phone.go`.

### Key files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `desktop/agent/phone_backend.go` | Core: CRUD of projects, schema DSL, auth personas, seed runtime, export tgz, templates |
| `desktop/agent/phone_backend_http.go` | HTTP handlers (all paths above) |
| `desktop/agent/phone_backend_test.go` | Unit tests (slugify, create, todos template end-to-end, additive schema, export tar, promote dry-run) |
| `desktop/agent/mcp_phone.go` | MCP tool schemas + dispatcher |
| `mobile/src/lib/phoneProjects.ts` | Mobile P2P client — types mirror the Go structs |
| `mobile/app/phone-projects.tsx` | Mobile list + inline wizard |
| `mobile/app/phone-project/[slug].tsx` | Mobile detail: tables browser, insert, export, promote |
| `web/lib/agent-client.ts` | Web client methods + types |
| `web/components/dashboard/PhoneProjectsView.tsx` | Web dashboard view (list + detail in one pane) |

### How promotion works

`POST /phone/projects/promote` calls `SwitchEngine.Plan(projectDir, targetID, dryRun)` where `projectDir` is the phone-project directory. Because each phone project has a valid `.yaver/config.yaml` (backend=sqlite), the switch engine sees it as a regular SQLite-backed Yaver project and plans the usual 7-layer migration (snapshot → provision → migrate-data → update-env → verify) with the right complexity tier. The 7-day rollback window applies.

## Networking Stack

> if the mobile app can't stop reconnecting or the relay log shows

Yaver's networking has three layers that work together for instant, reliable connections:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    CONNECTION PRIORITY                               │
│                                                                     │
│  1. LAN Beacon (direct)  ──  ~5ms   ── same WiFi, instant discovery│
│  2. Convex IP (direct)   ──  ~5ms   ── known IP from device registry│
│  3. QUIC Relay (proxied) ──  ~50ms  ── roaming, NAT traversal      │
│                                                                     │
│  Silent roaming: transitions between layers are invisible to user   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Layer 1: LAN Beacon Discovery (same network)

UDP broadcast protocol for instant same-network device discovery.

- **CLI** broadcasts a beacon every 3s on UDP port `19837` (`255.255.255.255`)
- **Mobile** listens on port `19837` via `react-native-udp`
- **Auth-aware**: beacon includes a token fingerprint (`th` = first 8 hex chars of SHA256(userId)) — only same-user devices match
- **Beacon payload** (~100 bytes):
  ```json
  {"v":1,"id":"dcbfdc50","p":18080,"n":"MacBook-Air","th":"a1b2c3d4"}
  ```
- Mobile matches beacon `id` against its Convex device list and `th` against its userId fingerprint
- Discovered devices get a `local: true` flag and their IP is used for direct HTTP connection
- If no beacon received for 10s → device marked as not local, falls back to relay
- **Graceful degradation**: if UDP socket fails (OS restriction, permission denied), everything works via Convex + relay

### Layer 2: Convex Device Registry (cross-network)

Central presence hub for auth, pairing, and cross-network visibility.

- **CLI** registers on `yaver serve` start: sends `{deviceId, hostname, platform, localIP, httpPort}` to Convex
- **CLI** heartbeat every 2 minutes includes current local IP (handles DHCP changes, VPN toggles)
- **Mobile** polls device list every 3 seconds — sees devices come online within seconds
- Device is "online" if `isOnline=true` AND `lastHeartbeat` within 5 minutes
- On `yaver serve` stop, CLI marks device offline immediately

### Layer 3: QUIC Relay (NAT traversal / roaming)

Application-layer QUIC relay for when direct connection isn't possible.

- **Desktop agent** connects outbound to all relay servers via QUIC tunnels on startup (solves NAT — no inbound ports needed)
- **Mobile app** makes short-lived HTTP requests to relay (IP changes from Wi-Fi/5G roaming don't matter)
- **Relay is pass-through** — no task data, logs, or AI output is stored on relay servers
- **Password-protected** — relay server requires a shared secret for agent registration and HTTP proxy
- **Reconnection** uses exponential backoff (1s → 2s → 4s → 8s → max 30s)

### Connection Flow

```
Mobile connects to a device:
  │
  ├─ On WiFi?
  │   ├─ LAN beacon found? → direct HTTP to beacon IP:port (2s timeout)
  │   │   └─ Success → mode = "direct" ✓
  │   │
  │   ├─ Convex IP is private? → direct HTTP to Convex IP:port (2s timeout)
  │   │   └─ Success → mode = "direct" ✓
  │   │
  │   └─ Direct failed → try relay servers
  │       └─ Success → mode = "relay" ✓
  │
  ├─ On Cellular? → skip direct, try relay servers immediately
  │   └─ Success → mode = "relay" ✓
  │
  └─ All failed → error, reconnect with exponential backoff (max 15 attempts)

Network changes (WiFi ↔ cellular):
  → Full reconnect with new strategy
  → WiFi→Cellular: relay (direct skipped)
  → Cellular→WiFi: direct first (beacon rediscovered), relay fallback
  → All transitions are silent — no UI disruption
```

## Relay Server

Yaver uses application-layer QUIC relay servers for NAT traversal and roaming. Self-hostable via Docker with password auth.

### Relay server config
Relay servers can be configured locally in the CLI config (`~/.yaver/config.json`) or in the mobile app settings. Optionally, they can also be served from Convex `platformConfig`.

### Self-hosting a relay
See `relay/README.md` and `scripts/setup-relay.sh` for automated VPS setup with Docker + nginx + Let's Encrypt.

```bash
# Quick start with Docker
cd relay && RELAY_PASSWORD=your-secret docker compose up -d

# Or use the automated setup script
./scripts/setup-relay.sh <server-ip> <domain> --password <relay-password>
```

If you use Tailscale, you don't need a relay server at all. Just use `yaver serve --no-relay` and connect directly via Tailscale IP.

## Conventions
- Go code: standard Go project layout, `gofmt`
- TypeScript/React: functional components, hooks, no class components
- Convex: mutations for writes, queries for reads, HTTP actions for OAuth callbacks
- Mobile: always native builds (xcodebuild for iOS, Gradle for Android), never Expo CLI

## Tests

### Unit Tests
```bash
cd desktop/agent && go test -v ./...    # Run all agent tests (HTTP API, auth, MCP, ping, shutdown)
cd relay && go test -v ./...            # Run relay tests
```

Tests spin up real HTTP servers on random ports — no mocks, no external dependencies. Covers:
- Health, auth, CORS, task CRUD, agent status, ping/pong, shutdown
- **Server-client integration**: two agents on the same machine, verifies token isolation and task separation
- **MCP protocol**: initialize + tools/list JSON-RPC
- **SDK token security** (`sdk_token_test.go`): scope restriction, IP allowlist, IP binding, TLS cert generation, token cache isolation, new device tracking, cross-user rejection (25+ tests)

### Integration Test Suite
Full end-to-end test suite covering CLI-to-CLI connections via all transport modes, builds, and MCP.

```bash
# Run everything
./scripts/test-suite.sh

# Run specific test sections
./scripts/test-suite.sh --unit           # Go unit tests only
./scripts/test-suite.sh --builds         # Build verification (all platforms)
./scripts/test-suite.sh --lan            # LAN direct connection (localhost)
./scripts/test-suite.sh --relay          # Local relay server test
./scripts/test-suite.sh --relay-docker   # Deploy relay to Hetzner via Docker, test, teardown
./scripts/test-suite.sh --relay-binary   # Deploy relay to Hetzner as native binary, test, teardown
./scripts/test-suite.sh --tailscale      # Tailscale cross-machine (local ↔ Hetzner)
./scripts/test-suite.sh --cloudflare     # Cloudflare tunnel test

# Combine flags
./scripts/test-suite.sh --unit --lan --relay
```

**What it tests:**
| Section | What | Infra needed |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `--unit` | Go agent + relay unit tests | None |
| `--builds` | CLI (current + linux/amd64), relay, web, backend typecheck, mobile typecheck, iOS, Android | Node.js, Go, Xcode (macOS), Java 17 (Android) |
| `--lan` | Auth rejection, task CRUD via direct HTTP, MCP protocol | Convex backend (for test account) |
| `--relay` | Local relay + agent registration, task flow via relay proxy, password rejection | Convex backend |
| `--relay-docker` | Deploy relay to Hetzner via Docker, register agent, test proxy, teardown | `REMOTE_SERVER_IP` + SSH key |
| `--relay-binary` | Deploy relay binary to Hetzner, register agent, test proxy, teardown | `REMOTE_SERVER_IP` + SSH key |
| `--tailscale` | Deploy agent to Hetzner, connect via Tailscale IPs, task flow | `REMOTE_SERVER_IP` + Tailscale on both machines |
| `--cloudflare` | Quick tunnel + named tunnel with CF Access service token | `cloudflared` + CF credentials |

**Credentials:** Loaded from (in priority order):
1. Environment variables (for CI — use GitHub Actions secrets)
2. `.env.test` in repo root (gitignored)
3. `../talos/.env.test` (for keeping creds outside this repo)

See `.env.test.example` for all available variables.

**No credentials needed:** `--unit`, `--lan`, `--relay` work out of the box.
**Need remote server:** `--relay-docker`, `--relay-binary`, `--tailscale` require `REMOTE_SERVER_IP` and SSH key.
**Need Cloudflare:** `--cloudflare` requires `cloudflared` installed (`brew install cloudflared`).

**CI:** Runs via `.github/workflows/test-suite.yml` on pushes to `main` and via manual `workflow_dispatch`.

### Running remote tests (private — credentials in .env.test)
The `.env.test` file (gitignored) contains credentials for the shared Hetzner server used by Talos/Yaver. It's loaded automatically by the test suite. To run remote tests:
```bash
# Remote relay + Tailscale + Cloudflare tests
./scripts/test-suite.sh --relay-docker --relay-binary --tailscale --cloudflare

# Full suite (all transports)
./scripts/test-suite.sh --unit --lan --relay --relay-docker --relay-binary --tailscale --cloudflare
```
The test suite auto-detects the remote server's CPU architecture (aarch64 on the Hetzner server) and cross-compiles accordingly. Each remote test deploys, tests, and tears down — nothing is left running on the server after the test suite finishes. Credentials are in `.env.test` or `../talos/.env.test` — **never commit these to the repo**.

### Browser E2E Tests (`e2e/`)
Playwright-driven browser tests that exercise the Next.js landing page + auth flow in Chromium. Free to run on GitHub Actions; public repo so minutes are unmetered.

```bash
cd e2e
npm install
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium   # first run only
npm test                                      # boots web dev server, runs headless
npm run test:headed                           # watch it in a real browser window
npm run test:ui                               # Playwright UI mode
npm run report                                # open last HTML report
```

**Dummy test user:** `global-setup.ts` creates a throwaway user against the live Convex backend (`POST /auth/signup` with a randomized `e2e-<uuid>@yaver.test` email) and `global-teardown.ts` deletes it via `/auth/delete-account` after the run. No credentials live in the repo and parallel runs never collide. To point tests at a deployed URL instead of the local dev server, set `E2E_BASE_URL=https://yaver.io` before running.

**CI:** `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` runs on PRs and pushes to `main` that touch `web/` or `e2e/`. It boots the Next.js dev server inside the job, runs Playwright against it, and uploads the HTML report + failure traces as artifacts.

### Running the Entire GitHub CI Suite Locally

`scripts/run-ci-local.sh` is the single entry point that reproduces every
`.github/workflows/*.yml` test job on your laptop using the exact same
commands the YAML runs. Use it before every PR to catch regressions without
burning GH Actions minutes.

```bash
./scripts/run-ci-local.sh              # run all five test workflows
./scripts/run-ci-local.sh --list       # enumerate the sections
./scripts/run-ci-local.sh ci           # only the ci.yml matrix
./scripts/run-ci-local.sh ci e2e       # several sections
SKIP_HEAVY=1 ./scripts/run-ci-local.sh # skip slow sections (Playwright,
                                       # Bento iOS bundle, hybrid-local)
VERBOSE=1 ./scripts/run-ci-local.sh    # tee every step to the terminal
```

| Section | GH workflow | Local command equivalent | What it checks | Heavy? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ci` | `ci.yml` | `go test ./...`, `go build`, `npm run build`, `tsc --noEmit`, `convex typecheck`, RN Feedback SDK jest | Per-component build + test matrix (gated by `paths-filter` on GH; runs all jobs locally) | 1-2 min |
| `e2e` | `e2e.yml` | `cd e2e && npx playwright test` (installs Chromium first) | Playwright browser tests against the landing page (login flow, hero rendering, etc.) | 3-5 min |
| `bento-e2e` | `bento-e2e.yml` | `go test -run TestBentoE2E_MobileFlow`, then Bento npm install + `tsc --noEmit` + `expo export --platform ios` | Mobile-flow agent integration + scaffolded Bento app compiles and bundles on iOS | 8-15 min |
| `test-suite` | `test-suite.yml` | `./scripts/test-suite.sh --unit --lan --relay` | Go unit tests + LAN direct connect + local relay server task flow | 2-4 min |
| `hybrid-local` | `hybrid-local.yml` | `./scripts/test-hybrid-local.sh` | Canned planner → Aider + Ollama + Qwen writes a calculator → Python asserts add/sub/mul/div work | 3-8 min (+pull time) |

Logs for each step land in `$TMPDIR/yaver-ci-local-$$/`; on a failing step,
the last 30 lines are printed inline and the full log path is echoed.

**What's left out**: release workflows (`release-cli.yml`, `release-web.yml`,
etc.) and cron maintenance (`tailscale-key-rotation.yml`) are not reproduced —
they require signing keys, TestFlight credentials, or write access to
external services. Run those on GitHub only.

**Dependencies per section** (install via `yaver install <name>` where applicable):
- `ci` — go, npm
- `e2e` — npm + Chromium (Playwright installs it)
- `bento-e2e` — go, npm, Xcode toolchain (for `expo export`)
- `test-suite` — go (`--unit`), go + TCP loopback (`--lan`), go + docker (`--relay`)
- `hybrid-local` — `yaver install hybrid` (ollama + aider + qwen2.5-coder:1.5b or larger)

### Running GitHub CI Tests from the Terminal
Use `./scripts/run-gh-ci.sh` to trigger one or all GitHub Actions workflows on the current branch, wait for them to finish, and dump the failing logs inline. Intended as the single entry point when the user says "run tests" / "run CI".

```bash
./scripts/run-gh-ci.sh                 # run every workflow_dispatch-enabled workflow on the current branch
./scripts/run-gh-ci.sh e2e             # run just .github/workflows/e2e.yml
./scripts/run-gh-ci.sh ci test-suite   # run several by name
./scripts/run-gh-ci.sh --list          # list available workflows on the current branch
```
The script requires `gh auth login` and assumes the workflows support `workflow_dispatch` (add `on: workflow_dispatch:` in any workflow you want to trigger manually). Failing step logs are printed with `gh run view --log-failed` so you can react without opening the browser.

## Local Development
- `cd backend && npx convex dev` — Start Convex dev server
- `cd web && npm run dev` — Start web dev server
- `cd mobile/ios && xcodebuild ...` or open in Xcode — Build and run on device/simulator
- `cd mobile && npm run web` — Run the mobile app in a browser (dev/preview only)
- `cd desktop/agent && go run . serve` — Run desktop agent
- `cd desktop/installer && npm run dist` — Build desktop installers (Electron GUI)
- `cd relay && go run . serve --password your-secret` — Run relay server locally

### Testing Yaver mobile on your iPhone — avoid TestFlight for iteration

TestFlight is rate-limited (~15-20 uploads per app per day; Apple returns `Upload limit reached. Please wait 1 day and try again` beyond that). Use it only for dogfooding a stable build, not for iterating on every code change.

**For iteration: direct device install via USB.** Much faster (~2-4 min after the first build) and no daily limit.

```bash
# 1. Find your iPhone's UDID
xcrun xctrace list devices 2>&1 | grep -v Simulator

# 2. Build + install to device (uses Xcode's automatic code signing)
cd mobile
npx expo run:ios --device <UDID>
```

This builds Debug configuration which needs Metro running on port 8081 to serve the JS bundle. If the app launches with a red error screen `No script URL provided` / `unsanitizedScriptURLString = (null)`, it means Metro isn't on port 8081 — start it with:

```bash
cd mobile
npx expo start --dev-client --port 8081 --host lan
```

Then tap **Reload JS** on the error screen — the app will fetch the bundle and start.

**Multiple RN projects on the same Mac fight for port 8081.** If Yaver, SFMG, Talos are all running Metros, only the first one gets 8081. Either:
- Kill the other Metros: `ps aux | grep "expo start" | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill`
- Or make each project explicit about its Metro port and rebuild the app binary to match that port.

**Don't try to "upload just to my phone only" via TestFlight for quick tests** — that still counts toward the daily upload quota. TestFlight is for running against real users/stable builds.

### iOS TestFlight deploy gotchas

- **`uploadSymbols` must be `false` in ExportOptions.plist** (already set in `scripts/deploy-testflight.sh`). Xcode 15+ treats missing dSYMs as fatal export errors, and `rnwhisper` ships without dSYMs. Apple symbolicates server-side from bitcode anyway, so skipping local dSYM upload is safe and lets the export succeed.
- **After TestFlight daily-limit error, wait ~24h**. There is no API to reset or query the remaining quota; the script will just keep failing with `Upload limit reached` until the window rolls over.
- **Archive is at `/tmp/Yaver.xcarchive`** after a successful archive phase. If the upload portion fails (e.g. Apple transient error, exit 70), re-run just the export step instead of rebuilding:
  ```bash
  xcodebuild -exportArchive \
    -archivePath /tmp/Yaver.xcarchive \
    -exportOptionsPlist /tmp/ExportOptions.plist \
    -exportPath /tmp/YaverExport -allowProvisioningUpdates \
    -authenticationKeyPath "$APP_STORE_KEY_PATH" \
    -authenticationKeyID "$APP_STORE_KEY_ID" \
    -authenticationKeyIssuerID "$APP_STORE_KEY_ISSUER"
  ```
- **`expo run:ios` with no `--device`** defaults to the iOS Simulator. When a physical iPhone is what the user wants, always pass `--device <UDID>`. The AI agent / Claude Code running tasks should inject the UDID automatically; never run `expo run:ios` bare.

### Android Play Store deploy gotchas

- **The upload keystore in `keys/yaver-upload.keystore` has a different SHA1 than what Google Play Console expects.** Current file SHA1: `5E:8F:16:06:…`; Play expects `12:63:75:D8:…`. This is blocking all Android releases.
- **Fix: request an upload key reset in Google Play Console** (Settings → App integrity → Upload key → Request upload key reset). Takes ~24-48h after which you upload the public cert of the new keystore. Alternative: locate the original `12:63:…` keystore if it exists on another machine.
- **`expo prebuild --clean` wipes `android/app/src/main/res/drawable/splashscreen_logo.*` and `android/keystore.properties`.** If a clean prebuild is run, restore both before `bundleRelease`:
  - `android/keystore.properties` → `storeFile=../../keys/yaver-upload.keystore` + passwords + alias (see existing file)
  - `android/app/src/main/res/drawable/splashscreen_logo.xml` — transparent shape drawable (already in the repo)
- **`android/app/build.gradle` signingConfigs.release block must be present** to wire `keystore.properties` into release builds. `expo prebuild --clean` resets this to `signingConfig signingConfigs.debug`, producing an AAB signed with the Android debug key — Play rejects it with SHA1 mismatch even if the upload keystore is correct.

### Dev-server / Hermes-push flow gotchas (mobile app)

- **`/dev/start` must NOT trigger `expo run:ios`** (agent v1.90.0+). Earlier versions ran a native build + install as part of "start dev server" which went to the Simulator by default and took 5 minutes per iteration. The current flow is Metro-only; the app loads via `/dev/build-native` (Hermes bytecode push) into Yaver's super-host bridge.
- **Second-tap "Open App" must also use Hermes push.** `apps.tsx handleTapProject` and `handleOpen` now always call `handleOpenNative` (Hermes path), never `handleDirectBuild` (Xcode build). When on LAN-direct mode these used to branch to `handleDirectBuild`, which re-triggered a 5-min Xcode build on the Simulator — that branch is gone in the current code and must stay gone.
- **Back to Yaver (shake overlay) posts `/dev/stop` to the agent** before restoring Yaver's own bundle. This guarantees a clean initial state for the next "Open App". `YaverBundleLoader` stashes agent base URL + auth token in UserDefaults when a guest bundle loads, so the native AppDelegate can hit `/dev/stop` even though no Yaver JS is running at that moment.
- **Claude Code tasks must not fall back to `expo run:ios`.** The prompts sent from `apps.tsx` fallback path explicitly forbid `expo run:ios`, `xcodebuild`, `gradlew`, etc. If a future prompt sneaks in "start dev server", Claude Code will run `expo run:ios` and the user ends up watching a 5-min build to the simulator. The prompt template must say *"Call POST /dev/start with workDir=X. Metro only — no expo run:ios, no xcodebuild. Mobile loads via Hermes push."*

### Mobile Web Target (dev-only)
The mobile app supports `expo start --web` as a development convenience so the UI can be iterated on in a browser without running a simulator. **Production is still iOS + Android only.** Notes:
- Enabled via `react-native-web`, `react-dom`, `@expo/metro-runtime` and the `web` section in `mobile/app.json`.
- The LAN beacon (`src/lib/beacon.ts`, `react-native-udp`) cannot run in a browser. A no-op stub at `src/lib/beacon.web.ts` is picked up automatically by Metro's `.web.ts` platform extension. Discovery just returns no local devices; the QUIC client falls through to its Convex-IP / relay paths.
- Apple Sign-In is unavailable on web (`expo-apple-authentication` stubs to `isAvailableAsync() => false`); the login screen falls back to the OAuth redirect flow.
- Direct HTTP connections to a desktop agent are subject to browser CORS/mixed-content rules — running against `http://localhost:18080` works; hitting private LAN IPs from an `https://` origin will not. Relay connections work as long as the relay serves HTTPS.
- Do not ship the web target anywhere user-facing without a security review: the mobile app talks to users' own desktop agents, and the browser threat model is different.

### CLI Development (`desktop/agent/`)
The `yaver` CLI is a Go binary in `desktop/agent/`. Run from source during development:
```bash
cd desktop/agent
go run . auth       # Sign in via browser (Apple/Google/Microsoft)
go run . serve      # Start agent server
go run . connect    # Connect to a remote agent
go run . status     # Show auth status
go run . devices    # List registered devices
go run . relay      # Manage relay server config
go run . guests     # Manage guest access (invite/list/remove)
go run . help       # Show all commands
```

Build a local binary: `cd desktop/agent && go build -o yaver .`

### CLI Release Process
1. Cross-compile: `GOOS=darwin GOARCH=arm64 go build -o yaver-darwin-arm64 .` (repeat for darwin/amd64, linux/arm64, linux/amd64, windows/amd64)
2. Sign Windows .exe: `./keys/sign-windows.sh yaver-windows-amd64.exe` (requires SimplySign Desktop logged in)
3. Create GitHub release with all binaries
4. Update SHA256 hashes in homebrew Formula and Scoop manifest
5. Users install via:
   - macOS/Linux: `brew tap kivanccakmak/yaver && brew install yaver`
   - Windows: `scoop bucket add yaver https://github.com/kivanccakmak/scoop-yaver && scoop install yaver`

### CLI Auth Flow
`yaver auth` opens `https://yaver.io/auth?client=desktop` in the browser. The web app handles OAuth (Apple/Google/Microsoft) and redirects back to `http://127.0.0.1:19836/callback?token=<token>`. The CLI's local HTTP server receives the token and saves it to `~/.yaver/config.json`. The token is long-lived and persists across reboots — no re-auth needed.

### Systemd Service (Linux — run on boot, auto-update)
For headless machines (Mac Mini, cloud VPS, dev servers), install Yaver as a systemd user service:
```bash
# One-time setup:
yaver auth                    # Sign in (requires browser — do this once)
yaver serve --install-systemd # Creates + enables + starts the service

# That's it. Yaver now:
# - Starts automatically on login/boot
# - Auto-updates from GitHub releases (checks every 6h, restarts with new binary)
# - Runs from $HOME, discovers all projects automatically
# - Survives reboots
```

**Management commands:**
```bash
systemctl --user status yaver   # Check status
journalctl --user -u yaver -f   # Live logs
systemctl --user restart yaver  # Restart
systemctl --user stop yaver     # Stop
systemctl --user disable yaver  # Disable auto-start
```

**How auth survives reboot:** `yaver auth` saves the token to `~/.yaver/config.json`. The systemd service reads it on startup. OAuth sign-in is only needed once — the token is long-lived.

**Auto-update:** The agent checks GitHub releases every 6 hours. When a new version is found, it downloads the binary, replaces itself, and exits. Systemd automatically restarts with the new version (via `Restart=on-failure`).

**macOS (launchd):** macOS doesn't use systemd. On macOS, `yaver serve` forks to background automatically and writes a PID file. Use `yaver stop` / `yaver logs` to manage. For login-item auto-start, use the Yaver desktop installer (`desktop/installer/`).

## Deployments

### Disk Space Guard

This machine hosts four mobile projects (`sfmg`, `talos`, `yaver`, `botox`). Xcode + Android SDK + simulator caches already consume ~30 GB, and an iOS archive or Android AAB burns another 5–10 GB transiently. **Before any mobile deploy, check free space and clean stale caches.**

```bash
# Run at the START of every mobile deploy — fails hard if < 20 GB free, auto-cleans first
mobile-cache-cleanup.sh preflight

# Status only
mobile-cache-cleanup.sh check            # disk free + per-project age + cache size

# Manual cleanup (safe, uses XDG cache)
mobile-cache-cleanup.sh clean-system     # Xcode DerivedData + stale simulators + Gradle transforms
mobile-cache-cleanup.sh clean-stale 7    # wipe caches for projects idle > 7 days
mobile-cache-cleanup.sh clean-project yaver
```

The script lives at `~/.local/bin/mobile-cache-cleanup.sh` and is **shared across sfmg, talos, yaver, and botox** — do not fork it into any repo. It detects "last deploy" from either a marker file in `~/.cache/mobile-cache-cleanup/` or from the last git commit that touched the mobile version files (`Info.plist`, `build.gradle`, `app.json`). A weekly launchd job (`local.mobile-cache-cleanup`, Sundays 03:00) runs `weekly` which does `clean-system` + `clean-stale 14` and logs to `~/.cache/mobile-cache-cleanup/weekly.log`.

**After a successful deploy, always call**:
```bash
mobile-cache-cleanup.sh mark-deployed yaver
```
so the stale-cleanup does not purge yaver's caches next run. The deploy scripts in `scripts/deploy-testflight.sh` and `scripts/deploy-playstore.sh` should end with this call.

Minimum free space for a mobile deploy: **20 GB**. If `preflight` exits non-zero, do not proceed — free more space manually (Downloads, old Docker images, `~/Library/Caches/*`) and retry.

### Convex Backend
```bash
cd backend
npx convex dev --once    # Push to dev
npx convex deploy --yes  # Push to prod
```

### Web (Cloudflare Workers)
Deploy via `@opennextjs/cloudflare` + `wrangler`:
```bash
./scripts/deploy-web.sh        # Size-guarded deploy (builds + wrangler deploy)
# Or directly:
cd web && npm run deploy        # runs: opennextjs-cloudflare && wrangler deploy
```

Environment variables are set in `wrangler.toml` or via `wrangler secret put <KEY>`.
DNS is managed in Cloudflare (yaver.io zone) — routes configured in `web/wrangler.toml`.

**CI deploy** triggers on `web/v*` tags via `.github/workflows/release-web.yml`.

**GitHub Actions secrets (for CI):**
| Secret | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` | Cloudflare API token ("Edit Cloudflare Workers" template) |
| `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` | Cloudflare account ID (from `wrangler whoami`) |
| `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` | Convex deploy key (for updating web version in Convex) |

To rotate the Cloudflare token: [Cloudflare Dashboard → Profile → API Tokens](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens). Create a new token with the "Edit Cloudflare Workers" template, scoped to the yaver.io zone, then update the GitHub secret via `gh secret set CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`.

### Relay Server
See `relay/README.md` for full deployment guide.

```bash
# Deploy via Docker
cd relay && ./deploy/up.sh <server-ip> --docker

# Stop relay
cd relay && ./deploy/down.sh <server-ip>

# Health check
curl https://<your-relay-domain>/health
```

### iOS — TestFlight (Local, No EAS, No Fastlane)

#### First-time setup
```bash
cd mobile
npx expo prebuild --platform ios
cd ios && pod install
```
> **Warning**: `npx expo prebuild --clean` resets CFBundleVersion to 1. Restore manually.

#### Deploy to TestFlight
```bash
export APP_STORE_KEY_PATH="$HOME/Workspace/talos/mobile/ios/AuthKey_77Z6B543D5.p8"
export APP_STORE_KEY_ID="77Z6B543D5"
export APP_STORE_KEY_ISSUER="7bd9329e-49b0-440a-97ed-873c74244c12"
export APPLE_TEAM_ID="5SJZ4KA39A"
./scripts/deploy-testflight.sh
```
> The script auto-bumps CFBundleVersion, archives, and uploads to TestFlight in one step.
> **Always deploy iOS and Android together** when making mobile changes:
> ```bash
> # iOS
> export APP_STORE_KEY_PATH="$HOME/Workspace/talos/mobile/ios/AuthKey_77Z6B543D5.p8"
> export APP_STORE_KEY_ID="77Z6B543D5"
> export APP_STORE_KEY_ISSUER="7bd9329e-49b0-440a-97ed-873c74244c12"
> export APPLE_TEAM_ID="5SJZ4KA39A"
> ./scripts/deploy-testflight.sh
>
> # Android

### Android — Google Play (Local)

#### First-time setup
```bash
cd mobile
npx expo prebuild --platform android
```

#### Deploy to Google Play
```bash
# Full deploy: bump versionCode + build AAB + upload to internal testing
JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 17) ./scripts/deploy-playstore.sh && \
  PLAY_STORE_KEY_FILE=keys/google-play-service-account.json python3 scripts/upload-playstore.py

# Or step by step:
# 1. Build (bumps versionCode, builds AAB):
JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 17) ./scripts/deploy-playstore.sh
# 2. Upload to internal testing track:
PLAY_STORE_KEY_FILE=keys/google-play-service-account.json python3 scripts/upload-playstore.py
```
> **The service account key is approved and working.** Upload goes directly to internal testing track.
> Always run both commands together — build then upload. The upload script auto-finds the AAB.
**Keystore**: `keys/yaver-upload.keystore` (alias: `yaver-upload`) — gitignored, alongside the service account JSON and Apple `.p8`.
**Service account**: `keys/google-play-service-account.json` — gitignored.
**Signing credentials (local)**: the whole `mobile/android/` tree is gitignored (regenerated by `npx expo prebuild`), so no template file is tracked. After each prebuild, create `mobile/android/keystore.properties` with the following shape, pulling values from the password manager:
```
storeFile=../../../keys/yaver-upload.keystore
storePassword=<from password manager>
keyAlias=yaver-upload
keyPassword=<from password manager>
```
Never commit this file. `build.gradle`'s `signingConfigs.release` block reads it if present.

**Signing credentials (CI)**: `.github/workflows/release-mobile.yml` base64-decodes `secrets.ANDROID_KEYSTORE` into `mobile/android/app/release.keystore` and passes `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` / `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS` / `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD` as env vars into a Groovy block it appends to `build.gradle`. No tracked credentials are needed.

#### Build release AAB only (no upload)
Requires Java 17:
```bash
cd mobile/android
JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 17) ./gradlew bundleRelease
```

#### Known issue: expo-modules-core `components.release` error
If Android build fails with `Could not get unknown property 'release' for SoftwareComponent`, patch `node_modules/expo-modules-core/android/ExpoModulesCorePlugin.gradle` line ~91: wrap `from components.release` in `if (components.findByName('release') != null)`. This is an Expo SDK 52 + AGP compatibility issue.

#### Known issue: `expo-share-intent` version
Must use `expo-share-intent@3.2.3` with Expo SDK 52. Version 4+ requires Expo 53+, version 6+ requires Expo 55+.

### SDK Publishing

#### npm (`yaver-cli`) — Push-to-Device CLI
Requires npm org `@yaver` and a granular access token with publish permission.
Token stored as `NPM_TOKEN` GitHub Actions secret. **Never commit tokens to repo.**
```bash
# Local publish (token in .npmrc, gitignored)
echo "//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=YOUR_TOKEN" > cli/.npmrc
cd cli && npm install && npm publish --access public
```
Before publishing, ensure:
1. `cli/sdk-manifest.json` matches `mobile/sdk-manifest.json` (copy if updated)
2. `cli/hermesc/` contains hermesc binaries for all platforms (from yaver.io's exact Hermes build)
3. Version in `cli/package.json` is bumped

#### npm (`yaver-sdk`) — Programmatic SDK
Same npm org and token as above.
```bash
echo "//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=YOUR_TOKEN" > sdk/js/.npmrc
cd sdk/js && npm publish --access public
```

#### PyPI (`yaver`)
Requires a PyPI API token. Token stored as `PYPI_TOKEN` GitHub Actions secret.
```bash
cd sdk/python
python3 -m build
python3 -m twine upload dist/* --username __token__ --password YOUR_PYPI_TOKEN
```

#### Flutter/Dart (`yaver` on pub.dev)
Requires a pub.dev account linked to a verified publisher.
```bash
cd sdk/flutter && dart pub publish
```

#### Go (`github.com/kivanccakmak/yaver.io/sdk/go/yaver`)
No publishing needed — Go modules import directly from GitHub via `go get`.

#### C shared library
Built locally per-platform. Not published to a registry.
```bash
cd sdk/go/clib
go build -buildmode=c-shared -o libyaver.so .   # Linux
go build -buildmode=c-shared -o libyaver.dylib . # macOS
```

### SDK Testing
```bash
./scripts/test-suite.sh --sdk   # Unit + integration (starts agent, tests all SDKs)
```

### Version Bumping (before releases)
Update version in **four** places — all must match:
1. `mobile/app.json` → `expo.version` (e.g. "1.0.1")
2. `mobile/ios/Yaver/Info.plist` → `CFBundleShortVersionString` (e.g. "1.0.1")
3. `mobile/ios/Yaver.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` → `MARKETING_VERSION` (e.g. 1.0.1) — appears twice (Debug + Release)
4. `mobile/android/app/build.gradle` → `versionName` (e.g. "1.0.1")
5. `desktop/agent/main.go` → `const version` (e.g. "1.40.0")
6. `web/app/page.tsx` → version badges (grep for old version number)

Build numbers (CFBundleVersion / versionCode) are auto-incremented by deploy scripts.
